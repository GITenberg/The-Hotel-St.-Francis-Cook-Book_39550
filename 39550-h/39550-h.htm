<h3 class="p6">PREFACE</h3>

<p>In this, my book, I have endeavored to give
expression to the art of cookery as developed in
recent years in keeping with the importance of the
catering business, in particular the hotel business,
which, in America, now leads the world.</p>

<p>I have been fortunate in studying under the
great masters of the art in Europe and America;
and since my graduation as Chef I have made
several journeys of observation to New York, and
to England, France and Switzerland to learn the
new in cooking and catering.</p>

<p>I have named my book The Hotel St. Francis
Cook Book in compliment to the house which has
given me in so generous measure the opportunity
to produce and reproduce, always with the object
of reflecting a cuisine that is the best possible.</p>

<p><b>Eggs Oriental.</b> Put on a plate one slice of tomato fried in butter, on top
of the tomato place six slices of cucumber simmered in butter and well seasoned,
on top of that one poached egg, and cover with sauce Hollandaise.</p>

<p><b>Tripe and potatoes, family style.</b> Slice the white ends of six leeks very
fine, put in sauce pan with four ounces of butter and simmer for five minutes.
Then add a scant spoonful of flour and simmer again. Then add one pound of
tripe cut in pieces one inch square, one pint of bouillon, two raw potatoes sliced
fine, some chopped parsley, salt and pepper, and one-half glass of white wine.
Cover and cook for an hour, or until all is soft.</p>

<p><b>Boiled whitefish, Netherland style.</b> Boil, and serve on napkin with small
boiled potatoes, lemon and parsley. Serve melted butter separate.</p>

<p><b>Squab pot pie, à l'Anglaise.</b> Roast the squabs and cut in two. Fry a thin
slice of fillet of beef on both sides, over a quick fire, in melted butter. Put
both in a pie dish with a chopped shallot that was merely heated with the fillet,
six heads of canned or fresh mushrooms, one-half of a hard-boiled egg, a little
chopped parsley, and some flour gravy made from the roasted squab juice, and
well seasoned with a little Worcestershire sauce. Cover with pie dough and
bake for twenty minutes. This is for an individual pie; make in the same
proportions for a large pie.</p>

<p><b>Lemon water ice.</b> One quart of water, one pound of sugar, and four lemons.
Dissolve the sugar in the water, add the rinds of two lemons and the juice of
four lemons. Strain and freeze.</p>

<p><b>Orange water ice.</b> One quart of water, one pound of sugar, three oranges
and one lemon. Melt the sugar in the water, add the juice of the oranges and
the lemon, and one drop of coloring. Strain and freeze.</p>

<p><b>Strawberry water ice.</b> One-half pound of sugar, one pint of water, one
pint of strawberry pulp, the juice of one lemon, and coloring. Strain and freeze.</p>

<p><b>Raspberry water ice.</b> Same directions as for strawberry water ice. Use
raspberry pulp instead.</p>

<p><b>Cantaloupe water ice.</b> Add to one quart of cantaloupe pulp the juice of
three lemons and a half pound of sugar. Pass through a fine sieve and freeze.</p>

<p><b>Omelet with oysters.</b> Parboil six oysters, add one spoonful of cream sauce
and season well. Make the omelet, and before turning over on platter place
the oysters in the center. Serve with light cream around the omelet.</p>

<p><b>Perch sauté, meunière.</b> Season the fish well with salt and pepper, roll in
flour, put in frying pan and cook with butter. When done, put fish on platter,
and put a fresh piece of butter in pan, over fire, and allow to become hazelnut
color. Pour the butter and the juice of a lemon over the fish, sprinkle with
chopped parsley, and garnish with quartered lemons and parsley in branches.</p>

<p><b>Browned hashed potatoes.</b> Hash three cold boiled potatoes. Melt three
ounces of butter in a frying pan, add the potatoes, season with salt and pepper,
and fry evenly. When nearly done form in the pan in the shape of a rolled
omelet and fry again until well browned on the top. Turn over on platter in
the same manner as an omelet, and sprinkle with chopped parsley.</p>

<p><b>Lobster salad.</b> Take the tails of two boiled lobsters, season with salt and
pepper and a teaspoonful of vinegar, and let stand for a half hour, then add one
cup of mayonnaise sauce. Put some sliced lettuce in the bottom of a salad
bowl, the lobster salad on top, a few nice lettuce leaves around the sides,
cover the salad again with mayonnaise, and decorate with hard-boiled eggs,
beets and olives.</p>

<p><b>Lobster salad with anchovies.</b> Same as above. Decorate with fillets of
anchovies.</p>

<p><b>Floating island.</b> Beat the whites of six eggs very stiff, add six ounces of
powdered sugar and the inside of a vanilla bean. Mix well. Boil one quart of
milk, one-quarter pound of sugar, and the remainder of the vanilla bean, in a
wide vessel. Dip a tablespoon in hot water and form the beaten eggs, or
meringue, into the shape and size of an egg, and drop into the boiling milk.
Dip the spoon in hot water each time so the meringue will not stick. Take off
the fire and let stand for a few minutes, turning the floating eggs several times.
Then take out of the milk and dress on napkin to cool. Boil the milk again and
bind with the yolks of two eggs, strain and cool. Put the sauce in a bowl, or
deep dish, and float the "islands" on top. Serve very cold.</p>

<p><b>Chicken salad, Victor.</b> Cut the breast of a boiled soup hen or boiled
chicken in half-inch squares, add one-half cup of string beans cut in pieces one
inch long, a cup of boiled rice, one peeled tomato cut in small squares and one
sliced truffle. Season with salt, fresh-ground black pepper, a little chives,
chervil, parsley, one spoonful of tarragon vinegar and two spoonsful of best
olive oil. Mix well and serve on lettuce leaves.</p>

<p><b>Potage Normande.</b> Velouté with Julienne of carrots and turnips.</p>

<p><b>Fillet of turbot, Daumont.</b> Put the fillet in a buttered pan, season with
salt and pepper, and add one glass of white wine. Boil six fresh mushrooms in
a little water and strain the juice over the fish, or use the juice of canned mushrooms.
Cook the fish, remove to platter, and reduce the sauce to glace, then
add one pint of sauce au vin blanc (white wine sauce), strain, and before
pouring over the fish add two ounces of sweet butter and the juice of one lemon.</p>

<p><b>Sirloin of beef, Clermont.</b> Roast sirloin of beef, sauce Madère, garnished
with tomatoes stuffed with whole chestnuts, and Bermuda onions stuffed with
cabbage.</p>

<p><b>Boiled chestnuts.</b> Cut the chestnut shells with a sharp knife and put on
pan in oven for ten minutes. Then peel, put in vessel with a small piece of
celery, salt, and cover with water. Boil slowly so they will remain whole when
done. Use for garnishing, stuffing, etc.</p>

<p><b>Tomatoes stuffed with chestnuts.</b> Peel four nice fresh tomatoes, cut off
the tops, scoop out the insides, and fill with boiled chestnuts. Put a small piece
of butter on top, and put in oven for five minutes. Serve as a garnish, or as
an entrée with Madeira sauce.</p>

<p><b>Boiled cabbage.</b> Cut a head of cabbage in four, trim and wash well. Have
a kettle with salt water boiling. Put the cabbage in the kettle and cook until
nearly soft, then drain off nine-tenths of the water, add a small piece of ham,
or ham bone, and simmer till soft. Remove the ham or bone and prepare the
cabbage with cream, or any other style. For stuffing onions, cut the cabbage
up, add a little butter, and season with salt and pepper.</p>

<p><b>Stuffed onions with cabbage.</b> Peel four large Bermuda or Spanish onions.
Boil them in salt water until nearly done, then remove from the fire and allow
to cool. Take out the inside and fill with cabbage prepared as above. Put the
stuffed onions on a buttered dish with a piece of butter on top, and bake in oven.</p>

<p><b>Consommé Julienne.</b> The word "Julienne" is a common kitchen term,
signifying cut in slender strips, or match shape. For consommé garnish cut
"Julienne" style one carrot, one turnip, one leek, a small piece of celery, four
leaves of cabbage, and one-half of an onion. Season with a spoonful of salt,
and one-half teaspoonful of sugar. Mix well. Put in a well-buttered casserole,
cover with buttered paper and the casserole cover, put in oven moderately
hot, and allow to simmer slowly. Turn occasionally, using a fork to avoid
breaking the vegetables. They should simmer without adding liquid, but
should they be too dry, a half cup of consommé may be added. Cook until soft,
and drain on a sieve so all the juice will run off. Combine with two quarts
of consommé, and before serving add a few peas and some chervil.</p>

<p><b>Fillet of sole, Gasser.</b> Put four fillets of sole in cold milk seasoned with
salt and pepper, and leave for four hours. Then wrap around raw potatoes,
cut like a cork, and about three inches long. Let one side extend over the
potato, and fasten with a toothpick. Fry slowly in swimming lard until golden
brown, then take out, remove the toothpick, push out the potato, and fill the
center of the sole with a very thick filling composed of two-thirds Béarnaise

pot and bring to the boiling point. Add the spinach, and boil over a very hot
fire, so it will remain green. It will require from five to ten minutes, depending
upon the tenderness of the spinach. Drain off water and serve plain. Or,
cool with cold water, press dry with the hand, and prepare as desired.</p>

<p><b>Spinach, English style.</b> Add a small piece of butter to plain spinach.</p>

and a piece of onion, brown well, basting from time to time. When almost
done drain off the butter, add a cup of stock and a little brown gravy, and
finish roasting. Strain the gravy over the chicken when serving. Serve in
a casserole.</p>

<p><b>Potatoes à la Reine.</b> Mix well, one cup of boiling water, one ounce of
butter, and a half cup of flour; cool a little, and add the yolks of two eggs.
Mix this dough with equal parts of fresh-boiled potatoes passed through a
fine sieve, season with salt and a little grated nutmeg. Take up, with a spoon,
in pieces the size of an egg, and drop one by one in warm swimming lard,
heating gradually, so the potato will have time to swell (souffle), before
becoming a golden brown color. When done, salt, and serve on napkin.</p>

<p><b>D'Uxelles.</b> Put in flat sauce pan three ounces of butter, one chopped
onion, and a slice of ham cut in small dices. Simmer for five minutes. Add
the stems of fresh or canned mushrooms chopped very fine, and simmer again
for five minutes; then add one-half glass of white wine and reduce. Then
add one-half pint of brown gravy and boil for ten minutes. Finally stir in
one-half cup of fresh bread crumbs, the yolks of two eggs, and season with
salt and Cayenne pepper, and chopped parsley. D'Uxelles is used for garnishing
in many ways.</p>

<p><b>Stuffed fresh mushrooms.</b> Cut the stems from six fresh mushrooms,
wash the heads well, season with salt and pepper, and fill with D'Uxelles.
Place on a buttered dish, sprinkle with grated cheese, put a piece of butter
on the top of each, and bake in a moderate oven.</p>

flour, and allow to become nice and yellow, stirring all the while to prevent
its burning. Then add the pieces of hare and simmer for a few minutes;

cover and let simmer slowly. Parboil and fry in butter one dozen small
onions; also cut up one-half pound of salt pork in half-inch squares, and

of sherry, and three quarts of bouillon or stock. Clarify with the whites of
six eggs, bringing to a boil slowly. Cook until the feet are soft. Strain the
broth through cheese cloth, cut the calf's feet in small pieces and add to the
consommé.</p>

<p><b>New England boiled dinner.</b> Put a shoulder of salt pork in a pot, cover
with water, bring to a boil, and then allow to become cool. Then put the
pork in a pot with five pounds of brisket of beef, cover with water, add a little
salt, a bouquet garni, three whole turnips, three beets, three carrots and a
small head of cabbage. Cook until the vegetables are soft, then remove, and
continue cooking the meat until well done. Place the meat on a platter, slice,
and place the vegetables around the meat; add some plain boiled potatoes,
pour a little of the broth over all, and serve hot.</p>

Cook about one-quarter of a pound of sugar so that it will crack when cold.
It will require about 310 degrees. Dip a tablespoon into it and shake it over
a stick, to form filé sugar (commonly called spun sugar). Cut this sugar
in pieces and form in the shape of a ball, and put on top of the cup before
serving.</p>

<p><b>Eggs Oudinot.</b> Put some stuffed eggs in a shirred egg dish, cover with
cream sauce, sprinkle with the chopped yolks of hard-boiled eggs, put a small
piece of butter on the top of each, and bake in oven until brown.</p>

<p><b>Fricassee of veal.</b> Cut five pounds of shoulder and breast of veal in
pieces two and one-half inches square, put on fire in cold water, bring to the
boiling point, and then cool. Put back in vessel, cover with water, add one
carrot, one onion, a bouquet garni, a little salt, and boil until soft. Remove
the vegetables and bouquet, and use the broth to make the fricassee sauce.
Put in casserole on stove, six ounces of butter, when hot add three-quarters
cup of flour, heat through, then add three pints of the veal broth, stir well and
boil for ten minutes, then bind with the yolks of three eggs and a cup of cream.
Season and strain the sauce over the pieces of veal. Allow to stand five
minutes before serving. Noodles, spaghetti, or other paste, should be served,
either separate or on the side of plate with the stew.</p>

<p><b>Noodle dough.</b> Mix one pound of flour with five whole eggs, with a
very little or no salt, and a pony of kirschwasser, if desired. Mix well, roll
out very thin, and then let the dough become nearly dry. Then cut in strips.
Have a vessel on the fire, with about a gallon and a half of boiling water.
Add the noodles, and boil for seven minutes over a quick fire, so they will
not stick together. Drain off the water and pour two ounces of hot melted
butter over the noodles. A little grated nutmeg may be added, if desired.
Noodles, like macaroni, may be prepared in many ways.</p>

<p><b>Chocolate profiteroles.</b> Make some small cream puffs and fill with
whipped cream. Place on a deep dish and cover with a sauce made of one
pint of water, one-half pound of sugar, and three ounces of cocoa. Boil the
water with the sugar, then add the cocoa and stir well. Boil for five minutes.</p>

<p><b>Potage McDonald.</b> Boil one calf's brains in chicken broth. Make one
quart of cream of barley soup, and strain both together through a fine sieve.
Put in vessel and add one ounce of sweet butter, and, when melted, serve.
Do not let the soup boil after the two have been joined.</p>

<p><b>Fried chicken, Maryland.</b> Cut up a spring chicken, put in flour, then in
eggs, and then in bread crumbs. Season with salt and pepper. Melt three
ounces of butter in a frying pan, and when hot add the breaded chicken and
fry until golden brown, but be careful not to burn it. It will require about
twelve minutes for a young chicken. When done, put on platter with cream
sauce over the bottom, and garnish with four corn fritters, four small potato
croquettes the size of an ordinary cork, and four strips of fried bacon on top.</p>

<p><b>Scrambled eggs with morilles.</b> Morilles are a species of mushroom rarely
found in the United States. They come principally from Europe in cans, or
dried. When fresh ones are used, sauté in butter and mix with the scrambled
eggs. When in can, drain off the water, put in sauce pan with a piece of
butter, season with salt and pepper, simmer for ten minutes, and add to the
eggs. When dried, soak them in cold water over night, wash, and then
proceed in the same manner as with the canned ones.</p>

<p><b>Planked sirloin steak.</b> Broil the steak in the usual manner. When nearly
done put on a meat plank, put four slices of broiled tomatoes on top, place
four strips of broiled bacon across the tomatoes, and roast in oven for five
minutes. Cover with maître d'hôtel sauce, and garnish with Parisian potatoes,
parsley in branches, and quartered lemon.</p>

<p><b>Consommé Bretonne.</b> Make a Julienne of equal parts of celery, onions
and leeks, and serve in consommé.</p>

<p><b>Lobster Thermidor.</b> Cut a live lobster in two lengthwise, sprinkle with
olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and put in oven and bake. When done
remove the meat from the shell and cut in small squares. Then make a sauce
as follows: Chop two shallots, a little parsley and tarragon, add one spoonful
of meat extract, or some good meat gravy, and reduce by boiling until nearly
dry. Then add one spoonful of dry mustard, one cup of cream sauce, and
two ounces of fresh butter. Put some of the sauce in the bottom of the shells,
put the lobster in the sauce, and pour the remainder over the top. Sprinkle
with grated cheese, and bake in oven until brown.</p>

<p><b>Eggs Chipolata.</b> Make some shirred eggs and garnish with sauce
Madère, to which has been added two small roasted onions, two heads of
mushrooms, two small French carrots, three boiled chestnuts, and two very
small fried sausages.</p>

<p><b>Consommé parfait.</b> To one pint of lukewarm consommé tapioca add
four raw beaten eggs, put in buttered mould, set in pan in boiling water, and
put in moderate oven for ten minutes. Allow to cool, cut in slices, and serve
in consommé.</p>

<p><b>Pimentos à l'huile.</b> This is a plain hors d'oeuvres. Take a can of pimentos,
drain off the juice, cut the pepper in four; place on a platter, season with
salt and pepper, add one part vinegar and two parts olive oil, and sprinkle
with chopped parsley.</p>

<p><b>Leg of lamb, Boulangère.</b> Season a leg of lamb with salt and pepper,
and rub with garlic and butter. Put in roasting pan with a cup of water and
a bouquet garni. Slice two large onions very fine, also six raw potatoes the
size of a silver dollar, mix, season with salt and pepper, and place around the
leg of lamb. Put small pieces of butter on top, put in oven, and baste the
meat only. It will require about one and one-quarter hours to cook. Do not
disturb the potatoes while cooking. When done remove the bouquet garni,
and serve the meat and potatoes very hot, with chopped parsley on top.</p>

<p><b>Rolled oats pudding.</b> Boil one pint of milk with half of a split vanilla
bean; add two ounces of rolled oats and two ounces of sugar, and cook for
about ten minutes. Remove from the fire. Separate the yolks and whites of
four eggs, add the yolks to the rolled oats and mix well. Beat the whites
very hard with a whip, and add to the batter lightly. Put in buttered pudding
mould and bake in bain-marie (hot water bath) for about thirty minutes.
Take out of mould and serve with vanilla cream sauce.</p>

<p><b>Vanilla cream sauce.</b> Boil one pint of milk with one-quarter of a split
vanilla bean. Mix one-quarter of a pound of sugar with two eggs and one

<p><b>Fillet of sole, Rose Caron.</b> Skin the four fillets of one large sole and
place on a buttered pan. Put on top of each, three slices of cooked lobster,
season with salt and paprika, add one-half glass of white wine, cover with
buttered paper, put in oven and cook for twelve minutes. Remove the fillets
to a platter, taking care that the lobster does not fall off. To the gravy in
the pan add one pint of white wine sauce and boil for ten minutes, then add
two tablespoonsful of écrevisse butter, and strain the sauce over the fish.
Heat in sherry wine sixteen slices of truffles, and put four on top of each
fillet, after the sauce has been added. Garnish with fleurons.</p>

<p><b>Sweet potatoes, Southern style.</b> Peel and slice some boiled sweet potatoes
and put in buttered shirred egg dishes, or pie plates. Add a little salt,
molasses and maple syrup, sprinkle with powdered sugar, put some small
bits of butter on top, and bake in oven until brown.</p>

<p><b>Vol au vent, or patty shells.</b> Take some puff paste, with six turns, and
roll out to about one-quarter inch in thickness. With a round pastry cutter
about three inches in diameter, cut the paste. Then moisten with egg, and
with the tip of a small knife trace a ring on each patty about one-half inch
from the edge. Bake in a hot oven for about twenty minutes. Take out of
the oven and with the knife point lift off the center cover within the traced
circle, and empty of the uncooked paste inside.</p>

<p><b>Garniture Toulouse.</b> Cut the garnishing to agree with the size of the
patty. For the size described above cut in pieces about one-half inch square.
For larger patties cut from an inch to an inch and a half square. Use the
boiled breast of chicken, sweetbreads boiled in chicken broth, and French
mushrooms in equal parts, one-half of a sliced truffle to each person, three
chicken dumplings, teaspoon size cut in two, rooster kidneys and rooster
combs. Mix well, and stew in a sauce Allemande made of chicken broth and
well seasoned. Fill the hot patty shells and serve on platter, garnished with
parsley in branches.</p>

<p><b>Mixed grill.</b> Broil one lamb chop, one breakfast sausage, one slice of
tomato, one whole fresh mushroom head, and one whole lamb kidney. Put
all on a plate, cover with maître d'hôtel sauce, and serve hot. Garnish with
watercress.</p>

<p><b>Cup custard.</b> Mix four eggs, one-quarter pound of sugar, one pint of
milk, and flavor with vanilla. Strain, pour into cups, and bake in bain-marie
until firm. It will require about one-half hour in a moderate oven.</p>

<p><b>Bain-marie.</b> This is a term used in cookery for a vessel holding hot
water in which another vessel may be heated at a temperature not above that
of boiling water. Different dishes are variously allowed to stand, cook or
bake in bain-marie. For example, Hollandaise sauce should be kept in bain-marie
in hot water. Hollandaise or Béarnaise sauce, if kept in boiling water,
would turn. A cream soup should be kept in boiling water, as extra cooking
will not harm it. Timbale of chicken, custard for soup, or cup custard, should
be cooked in bain-marie.</p>

<p><b>Purée Crécy (soup).</b> Slice six carrots very thin, put in casserole with
three ounces of butter, and simmer for thirty minutes. Then add three pints
of well-seasoned chicken broth, and boil for one hour. Strain through a fine
sieve. Serve in a separate dish small squares of bread fried in butter.</p>

<p><b>Roast leg of mutton.</b> The leg of mutton should hang in the ice box at
least four days before using. If too fresh it will be tough. Rub the mutton
with salt and pepper and, if desired, a little garlic. Put in a roasting pan,
one sliced onion, one sliced carrot, one bay leaf and two cloves. Now put
in the mutton, with a piece of butter on top, and place in oven to roast.
Baste continually. It will require from forty-five to sixty minutes to cook.
If desired well done cook for another thirty minutes. When done take out
the leg, drain off the fat, and make a gravy by adding one cup of stock and
one spoonful of meat extract; boil, season, and strain.</p>

<p><b>Thon mariné salad.</b> Tunny fish can be obtained in cans, the best quality
being the French brands. Break up the fish with the fingers, and place on a
platter with leaves of lettuce. The fish should be in pieces about one inch
and a half thick. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, chopped parsley, chervil, and
a little finely sliced chives, and a sauce of one-third vinegar and two-thirds
olive oil.</p>

<p><b>Stuffed breast of veal, au jus.</b> Have your butcher prepare a breast of
veal ready for stuffing. Use the same dressing as for chicken, and sew up
the end so the dressing will not fall out while roasting. Put in the roasting
pan one sliced onion and one carrot. Put in the veal and sprinkle with salt
and pepper. Put bits of butter all over the top and roast in oven, basting
often. It will take about an hour to cook in a moderate oven. Remove the
veal to platter when done, and make a sauce by adding to the gravy in pan
one cup of bouillon and one spoonful of meat extract, boil for five minutes,
and strain.</p>

<p><b>Asparagus tips, au gratin.</b> Put the tips in a buttered pan or silver dish,
cover with well-seasoned cream sauce, sprinkle with grated cheese and small
bits of butter and bake in oven until brown.</p>

<p><b>Corned beef and cabbage.</b> The best corned beef is that made from the
brisket. Put on fire in cold water and skim when it comes to the boiling
point. Cover and let it boil slowly until about three-quarters done. Then
add two heads of well-washed cabbage cut in four, and cook with the beef for
at least one hour.</p>

<p><b>Russian salad.</b> Equal parts of boiled carrots, turnips, beets and potatoes,
cut in small dice, boiled peas, boiled string beans cut in small pieces,
and one slice of cold roast beef cut in small squares. Put all in salad bowl,
season with salt, pepper, a little Cayenne pepper, and just enough tarragon
vinegar to wet the mixture. Let stand for one hour, drain off the liquid, if
any, and form the salad in pyramid shape in the bowl. Spread some thick
mayonnaise over all, and garnish with boiled potatoes and truffles, cut like
a five-cent piece, linking one to the other around the base of the salad like a
chain. On top put a small flower of a boiled and seasoned cauliflower, and
serve very cold.</p>

<p><b>Caramel custard.</b> Put two ounces of sugar in a copper pan and cook
until it is brown in color, then pour into a custard mould and allow to become
cold. Mix four eggs with one-quarter of a pound of sugar, flavor with vanilla,
add one pint of milk, and strain. Pour over the burned sugar, and fill the
mould. Put in bain-marie and cook until firm. When cool, reverse the custard
on a dish, and serve. The caramel at the bottom of the mould will
serve as a sauce.</p>

<p><b>Tomate Parisienne (Hors d'oeuvres).</b> Peel and slice four tomatoes and
lay on platter with lettuce leaves. Cut the inside of a stalk of celery in very
small dice, and six anchovies in small squares. Put in a bowl, add a pinch
of salt, some fresh-ground black pepper, some chives, parsley and chervil
chopped fine, and one spoonful of vinegar and two of olive oil. Mix well and
pour over the tomatoes.</p>

<p><b>Sorrel.</b> Sorrel is a fine vegetable for the promotion of health. Remove
the stems from a peck of sorrel and wash the leaves in four different waters,
to remove all the sand. Have a kettle with salted water on the fire. Put the
sorrel into the boiling water and cook for ten minutes, stirring often. Pour
off the water and let stand in the colander fifteen minutes so it will drain
dry, then strain through a fine sieve. Then put the sorrel in a sauce pan
with three ounces of butter and bring to the boiling point. Season with salt
and pepper, and bind with two whole eggs, beaten. Do not let it boil after
adding the eggs, but let it get just hot enough to give the sorrel a firm body.
Garnish with the half of a hard boiled egg, if desired.</p>

<p><b>Eggs à la Russe.</b> Spread a piece of toast with fresh caviar, put an egg
fried in oil on top, and put anchovy sauce around the edge on the platter.</p>

<p><b>Eggs fried in oil.</b> Fry the eggs one at a time. Have a very small frying
pan with plenty of very hot olive oil in it. Drop a fresh egg in it, and turn
with a wooden spoon. If any other kind of spoon is used the egg will stick
to it. When of a good yellow color, take out and place on a towel, so the oil
can drain off, and season with salt. The eggs should be soft inside, like a
poached egg.</p>

<p><b>Anchovy sauce.</b> To a cup of cream add one spoonful of essence of
anchovies, or one teaspoonful of anchovy paste. Anchovy sauce is also
made with sauce Allemande, white wine sauce, or even a brown sauce, if
desired. The cream sauce with the essence is more commonly used with eggs.</p>

<p><b>Boiled beef tongue.</b> Put a fresh beef tongue in cold water and bring
to the boiling point, skim, add salt, one carrot, one onion, a bouquet garni,
one stalk of celery, and one of leek. Boil until tongue is soft. The bouillon
may be used for stock or soup, or to make caper sauce. For beef tongue
with spinach, put plain boiled spinach on platter, sliced tongue on top, and
pour a little of the broth over all.</p>

<p><b>Raspberry Bavarois.</b> (For four or five persons.) One pint of milk, one
pint of whipped cream, the yolks of four eggs, one-quarter pound of sugar,
six sheets of French gelatine, and one-half pint of raspberry juice. Boil the
milk with the sugar, then pour over the yolks, and set on the fire again until
it thickens, but do not let it boil. Wash the gelatine in cold water, add to
the mixture, and stir until melted. Then set aside until cold. Mix the raspberry
pulp with the whipped cream, and stir into the mixture. Put in mould
and place in ice box until set. Turn out on platter, and serve with whipped
cream or raspberry syrup, separate or around the bavarois.</p>

<p><b>Sardines on toast.</b> Take sardines from can and put on a fine thin wire
broiler and heat quickly. Serve on toast with maître d'hôtel butter on top,
and garnish with quartered lemons and parsley.</p>

asparagus on a platter. Have the asparagus very hot. Sprinkle the tips with

lay it in a dish pan, cover with water, and squeeze out with the hands immediately.
Do not let it remain in the water but a second.</p>

Mix all together in a bowl, putting the liquids in last, making a thick, heavy
mixture. Put in a buttered mould or in a cloth, and boil in water, or steam
cook, for about three hours. This pudding, if kept in a cool place, will keep
indefinitely. Warm the pudding until very hot before serving, sprinkle some
powdered sugar over the top, pour on some brandy, and burn.</p>

<p><b>Brandy sauce.</b> Put in a vessel one-half pint of apricot pulp, made from
fresh or preserved fruit; one pint of water, and a half pound of sugar, and
boil. Moisten a teaspoonful of arrowroot with a little water and add it to
the boiling sauce, stirring so it will not get lumpy. Then strain and add a
small glassful of brandy.</p>

<p><b>Hard sauce.</b> Put in a bowl three-quarters of a pound of sweet butter,
one pound of sugar, the white of an egg, and flavor with lemon, vanilla or
a little brandy, and work into a cream. Put into a pastry bag with a tube,
and dress on a pan in small round shapes. Place in the ice box to get hard.</p>

waffle machine. Put them in warm swimming lard and let it become hot
gradually so the potatoes will not become brown too quick. When cooked
soft take them out and put them for a second into very hot fat so they will
become crisp and golden yellow. Serve on a napkin, sprinkled with salt.</p>

<p><b>Sybil and Gauffrette potatoes.</b> Same as waffle potatoes.</p>

<p><b>Artichokes filled with cauliflower.</b> Remove the leaves and trim the bottoms
of four cold artichokes. Cut in four a boiled and well-seasoned cauliflower,
squeeze out the water, and use to fill the artichoke bottoms. Cover
with a little thick cream sauce, sprinkle with grated cheese, place small bits
of butter on top of each, put on a buttered pan with a spoonful of bouillon,
and bake in the oven.</p>

<p><b>Potage Kroumir.</b> One quart of purée of tomato soup mixed with one pint
of consommé tapioca.</p>

<p><b>Aiguillettes of sole, marinière.</b> Take the four fillets from one sole and
lay them flat in a buttered pan, sprinkle with three chopped shallots, season
with salt and pepper, add one-half glass of white wine, one-half cup of stock
or water, cover with buttered paper, and bring to a boil on top of the stove.
Then put in oven and cook for about seven minutes. Put the fillets on a

small French peas.</p>

<p><b>Croustades.</b> One cup of flour, one cup of milk, the whites of three eggs,
a teaspoonful of olive oil, a teaspoonful of corn starch, and a little salt. Mix
well and strain. Keep the croustade iron very hot in swimming lard. Dip
the iron in the dough for a few seconds, then dip in the swimming lard, coated

<p><b>Poached eggs, à la Reine.</b> Spread some purée de foie gras on a piece of
toast. Put a poached egg on top, cover with cream sauce, and sprinkle with
finely chopped truffles. After the truffles have been chopped put in a napkin

easy to sprinkle.</p>

<p><b>Fillet of sole, Victoria.</b> Put four fillets in a buttered sauté pan, season
with salt and pepper, add one-half glass of white wine. When done put on
platter and pour a lobster sauce over the fish, with lobster and truffles cut in

pound of raw beef suet and four large onions very fine. Put in an earthen pot
half of the suet and onions, then half of the tripe and feet, then the remainder
of the suet and onions, followed by the rest of the tripe and feet. Season with
salt and pepper, add one bouquet garni, one-half pint of brandy, one pint of
white wine, and fill the remainder of the space in the pot with water. Put a
cover on the pot and seal with any kind of paste or dough, so that no air or
steam can escape. Then put the pot in a moderate oven and leave for about
eight hours; then take out of oven, take off the cover, and remove the bouquet
garni. If there should be too much fat on top a little may be taken off. Ordinarily
there will not be too much. Season to taste with salt and pepper, add
one-half pint of dry apple cider and one glass of brandy, and boil for two
minutes. Serve hot. The proper way to serve tripe à la mode de Caën is in
small individual earthen pots, on a large plate, with red-hot ashes under the pot.</p>

<p><b>Sweet-and-sour sauce.</b> Procure one-half pound of unsweetened spiced
fish cake from your grocer, break it in small pieces, put in a bowl, cover with
one pint of vinegar and one pound of brown sugar. Soak for about an hour,
then stir well, and add one cup of fish broth or meat stock, depending upon
whether it is to be used for fish or meat. Season with salt and a little Cayenne
pepper, then add one pound of seedless raisins, and boil again for five minutes.</p>

<p><b>Sweet-and-sour beef tongue.</b> Boil a fresh beef tongue in the same manner

sweet-and-sour sauce, and simmer for five minutes. Serve on a platter
covered with the sauce.</p>

<p><b>Omelette Suzanne.</b> Cut six macaroons in four and mix with a little
whipped cream. Cut six lady fingers in two and sprinkle with powdered cocoa

usual manner, powder with plenty of sugar, and burn bands across the top
with a hot iron. At one end of the omelet place the lady fingers, at the other
end the macaroons, and pour some of the Bar le Duc jelly on each side. Pour
a pony of Chartreuse over the omelet, then a pony of fine champagne, and
light it.</p>

<p><b>Cheese straws.</b> Roll out some puff paste (a good way to utilize any
trimmings you may have) very thin, about one-eighth inch. Wash the top with
eggs and spread with grated Parmesan cheese mixed with a little Cayenne
pepper. Cut in narrow strips, one-half inch by six, lay on a baking pan and
bake in a moderate oven until brown and crisp.</p>

<p><b>Onion soup, au gratin.</b> Slice three onions very fine, put in a casserole with
three ounces of butter, put on the cover, and simmer until of a golden color.
Then add one quart of consommé, stock or any good broth (consommé preferred),
season well, and boil for five minutes. Slice three rolls very thin and
put in oven and allow to remain until brown and dry, like toast. Put the soup
in an earthen casserole, float the slices of rolls on top, spread a cup of grated
cheese over the bread, put in a hot oven and cook until brown on top. Serve
very hot.</p>

top, and bake in hot oven until brown.</p>

a sharp knife, and well washed. If to be served hot, put in boiling salt water
over a hot fire about twenty minutes before serving. They should not be
cooked in advance. If to be served cold, as soon as the asparagus is done pour
a glass of cold water over them so they will not continue cooking and become
too soft. Allow to cool in the broth, and before serving lay on a towel or
napkin to allow the water to drip off.</p>

<p><b>Purée of salad.</b> (Vegetable). Boil in salted water, lettuce or any other
kind of green salad. When done drain off the water and press through a fine
colander. Add butter and a little cream.</p>

<p><b>Aiguillettes of bass, Massena.</b> Put four fillets of bass in a buttered pan,
season with salt and pepper; add one-half glass of white wine and one-half
glass of stock, bouillon, fish broth or water, cover with buttered paper, and
put in oven to bake. When done place the aiguillettes on a platter and cover
with the following sauce: Heat one and one-half ounces of butter in a sauce
pan, add one spoonful of flour and allow to become brown, add the fish broth
left from cooking the bass, one spoonful of meat extract, and one-half spoonful
of Worcestershire sauce. Boil for ten minutes, then add one-half teaspoonful
of essence of anchovies, and strain through cheese cloth. Boil one
dozen clams and cut in two; cut half of the tail of a lobster in small squares,
and six heads of mushrooms cut in two. Put all of this in the strained sauce,
and season well.</p>

<p><b>Giblet sauce.</b> Clean the giblets of chickens, turkeys, or other fowl, boil
in salt water, and chop. Put in casserole two chopped onions, and two ounces
of butter, and simmer for ten minutes, or until soft and yellow. Then add
one tablespoonful of flour, and simmer again until brown. Add the gravy
from a roast, the chopped giblets and a little of the water the giblets were
boiled in. Cook for half an hour, season with salt and pepper and chopped
parsley. A little sherry wine may be added before serving, if desired.</p>

<p><b>Stewed asparagus.</b> Cut up some asparagus tips and cook in a casserole
in salt water until soft. Mix a spoonful of flour and one ounce of butter and
add to the asparagus, with some of the water used for boiling. Use only
enough water to cover the asparagus. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and
pepper, and serve in a deep dish.</p>

<p><b>White bean soup.</b> Soak a quart of beans over night. Put in a vessel
with four quarts of water, or a mild soup stock. Add a half pound of lean
bacon, and a shinbone, if desired. Start to boil rapidly, then remove to back
of stove and cook for several hours until the beans drop to pieces. Skim from
time to time. Meanwhile chop very fine an onion, a carrot and a stalk of
celery, and simmer in butter until they take on a slightly brown color. Add
a spoonful of flour, a potato cut in small dices, and the water from the beans.
Strain the beans, and to the purée add the cooked vegetables; cut the bacon
in small pieces, and cook all together for twenty minutes. Season with salt,
pepper and chopped parsley.</p>

<p><b>Fried whitebait.</b> Wash the whitebait well and dry on a towel or napkin.
Roll in milk, then in flour, and fry in very hot swimming lard, just enough to
make them crisp. Lay them on a napkin, sprinkle with salt, and garnish
with fried parsley and quartered lemons. Serve brown bread and butter
sandwiches and sauce Tartar or rémoulade.</p>

<p><b>Pot au feu.</b> Put in a pot one brisket of beef; or five pounds of short ribs
of beef; two gallons of cold water, and a handful of salt. Bring slowly to
a boil and skim well, so the broth will remain clear. When the boiling point
is reached add two whole carrots, two turnips, three stalks of leeks, one stalk
of celery, a bouquet garni, one small head of Savoy cabbage, and two large
onions, all well washed. Bring to the boiling point again, cover, and put on
the side of the stove where it will simmer slowly. The vegetables will be
done before the meat, so when they are cooked remove them and throw out
the bouquet garni. Let the beef cook until very soft. Cut the vegetables, with
the exception of the onions, in thin slices; and when the beef is done strain
the broth over the vegetables. Give it another boil, season well, add some
chopped chervil, and serve with toasted bread crusts, separate.</p>

<p>The boiled beef may be served as an extra course, usually after the soup,
if no fish is served.</p>

<p><b>Loin of pork, baker's oven style.</b> For a large family, take eight pounds
of pork ribs, season with salt and pepper, rub with a piece of garlic thoroughly,
and put into a stoneware pot. Cut six large potatoes in strips lengthwise
and one inch square, slice three onions and add, with three pints of water,
a bay leaf and two cloves, to the meat. Your baker will bake it for you in
a brick oven, and it will be a dish quite different from the usual roasted pork.
If necessary, put it in your own oven, baking for not less than four hours
with a slow, even fire. However, it is preferable to have it baked in a
brick oven.</p>

<p><b>Fried chicken, Vienna style.</b> Cut a chicken in six pieces; two legs, two
wings, and two pieces of breast. Season with salt and pepper, roll in flour,
then in beaten eggs, and finally in fresh bread crumbs. Put in a sauté pan
in two spoonfuls of hot butter, and fry. When done dish up on a platter,
garnish with corn fritters, and serve sauce suprême separate.</p>

<p><b>Peas, farmer style.</b> Shell enough peas to make two cupsful. Take twelve
firm large asparagus tips, an onion, a firm head of lettuce cut fine, six small
French carrots cut in two, three ounces of butter, a pinch of salt and one of
sugar. Add enough water to cover, and simmer slowly until all the vegetables
are thoroughly done.</p>

<p><b>Sardines, vinaigrette.</b> Remove the skins from a can of sardines, and arrange
on a platter, on a lettuce leaf. Sprinkle with salt and fresh-ground
black pepper, pour a spoonful of vinaigre and one of olive oil over them, and
sprinkle with chopped parsley. Garnish with a lemon cut in half, two hard-boiled
eggs cut in two, some chopped onion on a small leaf of lettuce, and
another small leaf filled with small French capers.</p>

<p><b>Purée paysanne.</b> (Soup). Slice a carrot, an onion, a turnip, one-half of a
stalk of celery, two stalks of leeks, three leaves of cabbage, one-half pound of
squash or other fresh vegetable such as asparagus or tomatoes. Put them
in a vessel with one-half pound of fresh peas, and one-quarter pound of fresh
Lima beans. Cover with two quarts of bouillon and cook until soft. Strain
through a fine colander, put back in the vessel, bring to a boil, season with
salt and pepper, add two ounces of butter and mix well.</p>

<p><b>Young beets in butter.</b> Cut some young boiled beets in thin slices, put
in sauté pan with butter, season with salt and pepper, and simmer for a few
minutes.</p>

<p><b>Fillet of sole, Villeroi.</b> Put the fillets of a large sole in a buttered pan,
add some salt and a glass of milk, and bring to a boil, then set on side of stove
for ten minutes. Then remove the fillets to a platter. Mix in a cup one
spoonful of flour and one spoonful of butter, and add this to the milk broth
in the pan, which has been kept boiling, and cook for five minutes. Then
add one cup of cream and two ounces of sweet butter, whip well until melted,
season with salt and pepper, and strain over the fish.</p>

<p><b>Sponge cake.</b> One-half pound of sugar, six yolks of egg and six whole
eggs, one-half pound of flour, and flavoring. Beat the eggs and yolks and
sugar over a slow fire until blood warm. Then remove and continue beating
until cold and very light and spongy. Then add the flour and vanilla, or other
flavoring, and mix lightly. Put into paper-lined moulds or pan, and bake in
medium hot oven. Serve with powdered sugar dusted on top, or frosted.</p>

<p><b>Caroline cake.</b> (Chocolate or coffee). Make a dough as for cream puffs,
and dress on a pan in drops about quarter the size as for regular cream puffs.
Bake in a moderate oven; when done make a hole in the bottom of each with
a pointed stick, and fill with pastry cream, or sweetened whipped cream.
Place on a wire grill about one-quarter inch apart, and glacé with chocolate
or coffee icing. Let the icing dry, and serve in paper cases.</p>

minutes; then add a sliced onion and simmer slowly for ten minutes with the
cover over the pan. Then add a cup of cream and cook for four minutes, and add
one-half cup of cream sauce. Remove the chicken to a platter, pour the sauce
over it, and garnish both ends of the platter with macédoine of vegetables.</p>

<p><b>Macédoine of vegetables.</b> Macédoine is a mixture of vegetables, and
may be obtained in cans, but is easily made at home. If the canned sort is
used drain off the juice, put in casserole in cold water, bring to a boil, and
then drain off the water, season with salt and pepper, and simmer for a minute
or so. To make macédoine, use equal parts of carrots, turnips, string beans,
cut in squares about one-quarter inch in diameter, and peas and flageolet
beans. Boil each separately in salt water, and mix afterwards, season with
salt and pepper and one ounce of butter, and simmer as above. Flageolet
beans come in cans, or dry like dry peas. They may be omitted if desired.</p>

<p><b>Consommé Camino.</b> Boil one-quarter of a pound of macaroni in salt
water; when soft, drain, and cool in cold water. Then cut in small pieces
about one-half inch in length, and serve in a quart of consommé. Serve grated
cheese separate.</p>

<p><b>Fillet of bass, Menton.</b> Cut four fillets of bass; and prepare some fish
dumpling mixture. Spread some of the mixture over the fillets, and fold in
half, place in buttered sauté pan, add a little salt and one-half glass of white
wine, cover with buttered paper, and place in oven for fifteen minutes. Dish
up on a platter and cover with white wine sauce.</p>

<p><b>Beans, Normandy.</b> Soak two pounds beans over night, then put to boil
with three pints of water, sliced carrot, a yellow turnip, an onion, and a bouquet
garni, season with salt, and cook for an hour. Put two big spoonfuls of butter
and a spoonful of flour in a pan, and make a creamy sauce by adding the water
from the beans. Now fill a baking dish; first a layer of sliced potatoes mixed
with minced onions, then the semi-cooked beans, then potatoes, and so on
until filled. Then add half a glass of white vinegar and bake until the potatoes
are done, by which time the beans will be done also.</p>

lard. When done lay on napkin, garnish with quartered lemon and
fried parsley, and serve tomato sauce separate.</p>

<p><b>Diplomate pudding.</b> Take sponge, or any kind of left over cake and cut
in small pieces, using enough to fill a pudding mould. Add about a teaspoonful

and bake. Serve with brandy sauce with some chopped candied fruit in it.</p>

<p><b>Pompano, Café Anglaise.</b> Put four small whole pompano and four fillets
of pompano in a buttered sauté pan, and season with salt and pepper. Put
in another vessel one dozen clams and one dozen oysters, with their own
juice, and bring to a boil. Then strain the broth over the pompano and boil
until done. Remove the fish to platter, reduce the broth, then add one cup
of cream sauce and one cup of white wine sauce, and strain. Put the oysters
and clams and one dozen écrevisse tails in the sauce and pour over the fish.
The sauce should be well seasoned. Garnish with small fried fillets of sole.</p>

<p><b>Small fried fillets of sole.</b> Cut fillets of sole into small strips about one-quarter
inch thick and two inches long, roll in milk and then in flour, and
fry in hot swimming lard. When crisp take out of the fat and sprinkle with
salt. Serve with Tartar sauce as fried fillet of sole, or use as a garnish for fish.</p>

cover with hot water, season with salt, and when it comes to a boil, skim off
the foam but leave the fat. Add a soup bouquet with the addition of some
spices and a bay leaf. When the hen is half done, which will be in about an
hour, remove the bouquet, and add a cup of washed rice. Boil until the rice
is nearly done, by which time it has absorbed most of the broth; then put

for each pound of meat; peel, and serve with a sauce made of some clear soup
stock, Madeira sauce, three spoonfuls of molasses and a spoonful of French
mustard. The ham should be basted frequently while cooking.</p>

<p><b>Velvet soup.</b> Mince fine the red part of a few carrots, stew them with
butter, salt, sugar and a little broth. When done strain through a sieve. Put
a quart of clear broth on to boil, mix in four tablespoonfuls of tapioca, let it

<p><b>Broiled kippered herring.</b> Kippered herring may be obtained in cans.
Dip in oil and broil very lightly, cover with maître d'hôtel sauce, and garnish
with lemon and parsley.</p>

<p><b>Eggs, Carême.</b> Butter a shirred egg dish, crack two eggs into it, and
season with salt and pepper. Slice a truffle and a few canned mushrooms,
mix with a little cream sauce, and pour over the eggs. Bake in oven.</p>

<p><b>Hot buckwurst.</b> Secure the buckwurst from your butcher, lay them in
boiling water for ten minutes, but do not let the water boil after they have
been put in it.</p>

<p><b>Potage Eliza.</b> Same as potage santé.</p>

<p><b>How to boil terrapin.</b> Put two live terrapin into boiling water and leave
for two minutes. Then remove the outer skin from the feet, neck and head,
with a towel. Put the terrapin in a kettle with two quarts of cold water, an
onion, a carrot, a bay leaf, and one clove, and boil until the feet are soft. The
time required depends upon the age of the terrapin, some being cooked in
fifteen minutes, and others requiring two or three hours. When done open
the shell, take out all the meat, and the liver, removing the gall from the
latter with scissors. Remove the tail and claws and head. Cut up the legs
in inch-long pieces, or at the joints, as preferred. Reduce the broth by boiling
down to about a cupful, and put in a jar with the meat, and add a whiskey
glass of sherry wine. The terrapin is then ready to prepare in any style
desired.</p>

<p><b>Terrapin, Maryland.</b> Put one cup of terrapin, prepared as above, in a
flat pan, add a little grated nutmeg, salt and pepper, and half a glass of dry
sherry. Boil until half reduced, then add a cup of thick cream, boil, and
thicken with the yolks of two eggs, a quarter of a cup of thick cream and an
ounce of butter beaten together. Heat, but do not boil. Serve in chafing dish,
with dry sherry, and toast on the side.</p>

<p><b>Terrapin, Jockey club.</b> Same as Terrapin, Maryland. Before serving
add two ponies of Cognac and six slices of truffles.</p>

<p><b>Terrapin, Baltimore.</b> One cup of the prepared terrapin without the liver.
Put in saucepan with salt, pepper, nutmeg, celery salt, and a glass of dry
sherry. Boil for five minutes. Mash the liver in a salad bowl, add the yolks
of two raw eggs, one ounce of sweet butter, and strain through a fine sieve.
Add a cup of brown sauce to the simmering terrapin, then add the liver prepared
as above, pouring in gradually. Heat barely enough to thicken. Before
serving add half a glass of dry sherry.</p>

<p><b>Crab in chafing dish.</b> Mince a shallot onion and brown slightly with
two spoonfuls of butter. Add a spoonful of flour, mixing well, then add a
half pint of sweet milk, and stir to a smooth cream. Add the meat of a California
crab (or six eastern crabs) and a tablespoonful of sherry. Place toast,
cut in fancy shapes, on a deep platter, and cover with the crab. This is a favorite
way of preparing crab.</p>

<p><b>Crab meat au gratin.</b> Shred the meat of one crab, mix with a cup of
cream sauce and a little paprika, or Cayenne; or if this is too strong use white
pepper. Fill individual baking dishes, and sprinkle the top liberally with
grated Parmesan cheese. Bake in an oven until the top is an even brown.</p>

<p><b>Crab meat, Gourmet.</b> Put a quarter of a pound of picked shrimps in a
saucepan, add one ounce of butter and one-half whiskey-glassful of dry sherry
wine. Simmer for five minutes, then add the meat of one crab, prepared
Monza.</p>

<p><b>Crab meat, Suzette.</b> Bake four good-sized potatoes, and cut off one side
like the cover of a box. Scoop the insides out with a spoon, and fill with the
meat of one crab prepared in cream. Sprinkle some grated Parmesan or Swiss
cheese on top, and bake in oven until nice and brown. Serve on napkins, garnished
with parsley in branches and quartered lemons.</p>

<p><b>Oysters or crab, à la Poulette.</b> If for oysters, boil them in their own
liquid for about five minutes. If the small California oysters are used boil for
half that time. Into this liquid of, say, a pint of oysters, stir a heaping teaspoonful
of corn starch mixed with a half pint of white wine. Then beat the
yolks of two eggs with half a cup of cream, and stir slowly into the above,
add two large spoonfuls of butter, and keep on the stove but do not let it boil.
Finally squeeze in the juice of half a small lemon. If crab is used, cut the
meat in small pieces, and make the sauce in the same manner, but instead of
beginning with the juice of oysters for the foundation of the sauce, begin
with a cup and a half of cream and water in equal proportions, thicken with
corn starch, then add the yolks of eggs, etc., as above. The oysters or the
crab meat should be added last.</p>

<p><b>Crab meat, à la Louise.</b> Have the crab meat thoroughly chilled, and
allow one crab to three or four people, according to the size of the fish. Use
small fancy fish plates, or salad plates. Lay on each plate some slices of the
white hearts of firm heads of lettuce. Lay on top some canned Spanish
pimentos, using the brilliant red variety, which is sweet. On top of this place
the crab meat, taking care not to break it too small. Over all pour French
dressing made with tarragon vinegar, well-seasoned with freshly-ground black
pepper.</p>

ten minutes. Serve on platters, garnished with parsley and quartered lemons.</p>

<p><b>Prune soufflé.</b> Wash a cupful of prunes thoroughly, and soak them over
night. Boil them in the water in which they were soaked, flavoring with half
of a vanilla bean, and sweetened with a cupful of sugar. When done pour off
and save the juice. Strain the pulp through a colander or wire sieve, making
a good firm purée, and about a cupful in quantity. Whip the whites of six
eggs until dry, then whip in the prune pulp, and bake in the same manner as
an omelette soufflé. Bake on a platter, formed into a symmetrical mound;
or in a buttered pudding mould. Serve hot or cold, with a sauce made of the

<p><b>Broiled shad roe, ravigote.</b> Broil the roe, place on a platter, and cover
with a sauce made by mixing one-half cup of maître d'hôtel sauce with two
chopped vinegar pickles and one teaspoonful of French mustard.</p>

<p><b>Fillet of sole under glass.</b> Cut the fillets into pieces two inches square.
Into a buttered shirred egg dish put a piece of toast; on top of this place the
fish, season with salt and pepper, put three fresh mushroom heads on each
portion of fish, add a piece of butter about the size of an egg, and over all
squeeze the juice of half a lemon, and sprinkle with finely-chopped parsley.
Cover with a glass cover, such as used for mushrooms, put in a moderate oven
and cook for twenty minutes; being careful that the oven is not hot enough
to burn the toast. Then take from the oven, pour velouté sauce and a spoonful
of white wine over each portion, and return, to cook for another five minutes.
Any other fish may be substituted for sole, if desired.</p>

<p><b>Clam chowder, Boston style.</b> Put fifty clams, with their liquid, into a
saucepan and boil for three minutes. Then set the clams aside, strain the
broth and return to the fire. Chop fine, a medium-sized onion, and cut into
dice four slices of salt pork. Put a piece of butter into a pan, and fry the pork
and onion until light brown in color; stir in two tablespoonfuls of flour and
cook thoroughly, add the clam juice, a half pint of rich soup stock, and the
same amount of cream, a couple of diced potatoes, and a bit of thyme if the
flavor is liked. Cook for about ten minutes. Chop the clams, and add last
of all, as they do not require much cooking. Just before serving add a few
hard crackers broken into bits.</p>

<p><b>Crab cocktail, Victor.</b> Place a boiled crab on ice and chill thoroughly,
then remove the meat, taking care not to break the pieces more than necessary.
Make a sauce with three-quarters of a cup of tomato ketchup, a teaspoonful
of Worcestershire sauce, two tablespoonfuls of tarragon vinegar,
and a good pinch of freshly-ground pepper. Mix with the crab meat, fill the
cocktail glasses, place them in cracked ice, and serve.</p>

<p><b>Baked Alaska.</b> (Individual). Slice some sponge cake about one-half inch
thick, and cut with a round cutter two inches in diameter. Place the discs
of cake on a silver platter, put a ball of vanilla cream in the center of each, and
cover with meringue paste. Make the meringue with the whites of four eggs,
beaten well and mixed with one-half pound of powdered sugar. Use a pastry
bag with a fancy tube, and cover carefully; dust with powdered sugar, and
bake in a very hot oven for a couple of minutes. Put a French cherry on top
of each before serving.</p>

the seeds, and cut in small pieces. To every pound of fruit allow one-half
pound of granulated cane sugar. Cook the citron in water until quite clear,

and boil until very clear, then put in the drained citron, add two sliced large
lemons, a small piece of ginger root, and cook for about fifteen minutes. Fill
the jars with the citron, and cover with the syrup.</p>

hours until frozen. Dip the top of the biscuit in macaroon crumbs before
serving.</p>

<p><b>Saddle of hare, sour cream sauce.</b> Remove the skins from the saddles of
two hares, and lard them with thin strips of larding pork. Put them in an
agate pan, add a little salt, and one-half cup of whole black peppers wrapped
in cheese cloth. Cover with from two to three quarts of sour cream, and stand
in a cool place for forty-eight hours. Then put the saddles in a roasting pan

for about ten minutes, or until brown. Then strain the sour cream, and add
little by little to the saddles, while roasting. Baste continually, and after
forty minutes you should have a nice brown sauce. Remove the saddles to a
platter, reduce the sauce one-half, season with salt if necessary, and a little
paprika, strain part over the saddles, and serve the remainder in a bowl.</p>

<p><b>Corned beef hash.</b> Chop an onion very fine and put in a casserole with
two ounces of butter. Simmer until the onion is cooked, then add two pounds
of boiled corned beef cut in small dices, and one pound of boiled potatoes cut
very small, or chopped. Mix well, season with a little pepper, and salt if
necessary, add one cup of bouillon, and simmer for ten minutes. Before
serving add a little chopped parsley.</p>

<p><b>Browned corned beef hash.</b> Same as above, but use only one-half cup of
bouillon. Before serving put the hash in a frying pan with two ounces of
butter, and allow it to brown. Serve in the shape of an omelet.</p>

<p><b>Corned beef hash au gratin.</b> Make a corned beef hash and put in a buttered,
deep, silver vegetable dish, sprinkle with bread crumbs, put a small piece
of butter on top, and bake in oven until brown.</p>

<p><b>Lamb cutlets in papers.</b> Fry the cutlets in a sauté pan, in melted fat pork,
turning frequently. Brown only slightly, allowing them to remain rare. Then
remove the cutlets, and in the fat simmer some minced onions, mushrooms and
parsley for a few minutes. When nearly done add some shredded lean ham.
Now prepare some oiled paper, tearing it heart-shaped, lay the cutlet on one
half, surrounding it with the minced herbs, with a little on top also; then fold
over the paper, creasing the edges together like a hem. Lay on a buttered
dish, and set in oven until nicely colored.</p>

<p><b>Purée of onions (Soubise).</b> Peel and slice one dozen large white onions,
put in a casserole with one-quarter pound of butter, cover, and put in oven for
about forty-five minutes, or until soft; but do not allow them to become brown.
Then drain off the butter and add one pint of thick cream sauce, season well
with salt and white pepper, and strain through a fine sieve.</p>

<p><b>Venetian egg in chafing dish.</b> Mince an onion and cook in sauté pan in
two ounces of butter, then add half a can of firm tomatoes and cook for twenty
minutes. Add a pound of eastern cheese, broken into small bits; season with
salt, paprika, a little Worcestershire sauce, and half a teaspoonful of mustard.
Stir continuously. Last, add three lightly beaten eggs, and stir until thick. It
should be of the same consistency as a Welsh rabbit. Serve either with, or
on, toast or toasted crackers.</p>

<p><b>Eggs, Voltaire.</b> In the bottom of a buttered cocotte or egg dish place a
spoonful of chicken hash, on top break a raw egg, and season. Cover with
cream sauce and grated cheese. Bake until the tops are brown.</p>

<p><b>Cream of chicken, Reine Hortense.</b> Make a cream of chicken soup in the

three ounces of hot butter, mash fine, and force through a sieve. Stir in four
spoonfuls of cream, and spread over toast cut in fancy shapes. Garnish with
ripe and green olives. Serve as a fancy sandwich at tea or bridge parties, or as
an appetiser for dinner.</p>

<p><b>Braised sweetbreads, Marie Louise.</b> Soak the sweetbreads in cold water
for no less than three hours, changing the water two or three times. This
draws all the blood from the sweetbreads. Then put into a large pot, with
plenty of cold water, and bring to the boiling point; then drench with cold
water to cool. In a saucepan put a sliced carrot, a sliced onion, a bay leaf, a
clove, parsley in branches, a piece of salt pork rind, butter the size of half an
egg, and one cup of stock or broth of any kind. Place the sweetbreads on top,
and place in oven and cook for half an hour, basting frequently. The sweetbreads
should turn an even yellow. Trim some artichoke bottoms, cut in half,
and place the sweetbreads on top. Mix the juice from the baked sweetbreads
with a cup of cream sauce and a sherry glassful of dry sherry. Pour this
over the top, sprinkle with chopped parsley, and return to oven for two minutes.</p>

<p><b>Pears in syrup.</b> Make a syrup with a cup of sugar, and water enough to
cover. Add the juice or rind of a lemon, a few cloves, and a stick of cinnamon.
Quarter the pears, remove the cores, and cook in the syrup for eight or ten
minutes, or until tender. Old hard pears may require a half an hour or more
before they are sufficiently cooked. A little claret or white wine may be
added, if desired.</p>

sprinkle with plenty of powdered sugar, and burn with a red-hot poker. Warm
the apricots, and put at both ends of the omelet; pour two ponies of absinthe
over the top, and light before bringing to the table. Anisette liqueur may be
used in place of the absinthe if more convenient.</p>

</table>

<p><b>Cocoa cake.</b> Half a cup of butter, a cup of sugar, three eggs, a teaspoonful
of vanilla, three-fourths of a cup of milk, six level tablespoonfuls of cocoa,
two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, and one and three-fourth cups of sifted
flour. Cream the butter, adding the sugar gradually, then add the eggs one
by one, whipping vigorously. Sift together half of the flour, the cocoa and
the baking powder, then add the milk and the rest of the flour, making a
mixture that will drop from the spoon. When all is mixed together put in
a pan or mould, and bake for thirty-five minutes. Cover the cake with a plain
icing. A cake is baked when it shrinks from the pan, or if, when you press it,
it springs back.</p>

<p><b>Dubney sandwiches.</b> To a cupful of chopped chicken or turkey meat
add a spoonful of mayonnaise, a teaspoonful of minced onion, two minced
shallots, a pinch of chopped chives, and season with salt and pepper. Spread
on well-buttered warm toast.</p>

<p><b>Cream of almond sandwiches.</b> Mix a soft cream cheese with a cup of
crushed salted almonds, and a liqueur glassful of kirsch. Spread on thin
slices of brown bread.</p>

<p><b>Olive sandwiches.</b> Chop equal parts of olives and onions together, add
a few drops of olive oil and a little pepper, but no salt, as the olives have
enough. Spread on thin slices of buttered bread.</p>

<p><b>Windsor sandwiches.</b> Chop enough chicken or turkey to make a cup of
meat, add half as much chopped ham, and half a dozen chopped olives. Bind
together with mayonnaise. Spread on white and on brown buttered bread.</p>

<p><b>Créole sandwiches.</b> Chop some fresh or canned sweet peppers, bind
together with mayonnaise, and add a bit of minced parsley. Spread on both
white and brown bread. Always make the sandwiches dainty and thin.</p>

<p><b>Brown Betty.</b> Pull half a loaf of white bread to bits, or use bread crumbs.
The pulled bread makes the lighter pudding. Butter the inside of a pudding
dish liberally, put in a layer of crumbs, then twice as much sliced apple or
other fruit, sprinkle with sugar, nutmeg and bits of butter, add another layer
of crumbs, and so on, for about three layers, having the crumbs last. Bake
until brown, and the fruit well done, or about twenty minutes. Serve with
cream.</p>
<p><b>Eggs St. George.</b> Butter four cocotte dishes, put purée of onions on
bottom, a poached egg on top, cover with cream sauce, and sprinkle with
grated cheese. Bake in hot oven to color only.</p>

<p><b>Kieler sprotten.</b> This is a canned fish. Serve cold on lettuce leaves,
garnished with quartered lemons.</p>

<p><b>Omelette Schofield.</b> Boil a shad roe in salt water for ten minutes. Allow
to cool, and cut in dices one-quarter inch square. Heat a cup of cream sauce,
add the roe, and season with salt and Cayenne pepper. When making the
omelet place a little of the roe in the center; dress on a platter, and pour the
roe and cream sauce around the edge.</p>

<p><b>Fish chowder.</b> Cut a pound of some white fish, such as bass, codfish, or
sole, in dices about one-quarter inch square, and free from skin and bones.
Put the bones of the fish in a casserole and add three quarts of water, one
bouquet garni, and two tablespoonfuls of salt. Boil for thirty minutes, and
strain. Cut two pounds of potatoes in quarter inch squares, and boil in the
fish stock until soft, then add the fish and boil for five minutes, then add one
pint of boiling-hot cream, and season well with salt and white pepper. Before
serving add a little chopped parsley. Serve broken crackers separate.</p>

<p><b>Fillet of sole, Bretonne.</b> Boil four fillets of sole in a little salt water.
Dish up on a platter and cover with equal parts of Hollandaise and tomato
sauce mixed. Garnish with rings of fried onions.</p>

<p><b>Coffee custard.</b> Grind fine (but not pulverized), a half pound of Java
or other mildly flavored coffee. Put it into a quart of boiling milk and let it
infuse on the back of the stove for a half hour, then strain through cheese
cloth. Beat the yolks of six eggs with six ounces of sugar, add a spoonful of
cream, and stir into the hot milk, which has been heated again after straining
off the coffee. Let it cream, but do not boil; and then add the beaten whites
of three eggs. Use any flavoring desired, a dash of brandy or cognac being
very good. Fill the moulds, stand them in hot water, and place in a moderate
oven. When done, cool, serve with English cream, apricot juice or
just plain cream.</p>

<p><b>Grapefruit marmalade.</b> Shave two clean whole grapefruit very thin, rejecting
nothing but the seeds and cores. Measure the fruit, and add three
times the quantity of water, and let it stand in an earthenware dish over
night. Then boil for ten minutes, and let it stand another night. Then add
an equal quantity of sugar, and boil briskly until the mixture jells.</p>

turning carefully with a wooden spoon, so it will not stick to the bottom.
Then remove from the fire, add one cup of thick cream, and pour into deep
china vegetable dishes, and bake in a hot oven until brown on top. Use one
large dish for baking, or individual ones, as desired.</p>

<p><b>Crab salad, Louis.</b> Arrange lettuce leaves around the inside of a salad
bowl, with a few sliced leaves on the bottom. Put crab meat on top of the
sliced leaves, and a few sliced hard-boiled eggs and sliced chives on top of
the crab meat. In another bowl mix one-half cup of French dressing with
one-half cup of Chili sauce, two spoonfuls of mayonnaise, salt, pepper, and
one teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce. Pour over the salad, and serve
very cold.</p>

<p><b>Braised mutton chops.</b> Have six chops cut one and one-half inches thick,
season with salt and pepper. In a sauté pan on the stove put one spoonful
of fat or lard, and when hot add the chops and fry on both sides until brown.
Then drain off the fat, add two ounces of butter, sprinkle with a spoonful of
flour, add one pint of stock, one crushed tomato, one bay leaf, one clove; and
then simmer slowly for an hour and a half. When done place the chops on
a platter, season the sauce well, and strain over the chops.</p>

<p><b>Consommé Vivieurs.</b> Make a Julienne of beets, leeks and celery, in
equal parts, parboil in salt water, and finish cooking in consommé. Then add
the breast of a boiled chicken also cut Julienne. Chop a raw beet, press out
the juice and add to the consommé. This will give it a nice reddish color.
Serve croûtons diablé separate.</p>

<p><b>Croûtons diablé (for soup).</b> Use either white or rye bread, and cut in
round pieces the size of a quarter of a dollar. Mix some grated Parmesan
cheese with Cayenne pepper, and put on the round pieces of bread. Place on
a flat pan and bake in oven until brown. Serve on a napkin.</p>

<p><b>Fillet of sole, Suchet.</b> Make a Julienne of vegetables in the same manner
as for consommé. Prepare a fillet of sole, au vin blanc. When the sole is
done add the Julienne of vegetables to the white wine sauce, together with a
little chopped tarragon, and pour over the fish. Have the sauce well seasoned.</p>

<p><b>Sweetbreads braisé, Godard.</b> Braise the sweetbreads and dish up on a
platter. Garnish with whole truffles heated in sherry wine, and whole heads
of mushrooms fried in butter, rooster combs, rooster fries, and sauce Madère

<p><b>Knickerbocker salad.</b> On a long leaf of romaine salad put one slice of
grapefruit, then one slice of orange, and so on until the leaf is full. Then put
four fresh strawberries on top, cover with French dressing and garnish with
whipped cream. Serve on individual plates.</p>

<p><b>Purée of white beans, Soubise.</b> Soak two pounds of white beans in cold
water over night. Then put on fire with two quarts of water, six whole white
onions, one bouquet garni, one ham bone, and two pounds of veal bones.
Season with salt; and skim when it comes to a boil. When the beans are soft
remove the bouquet garni, ham and veal bones, strain the rest through a fine
sieve, and put back on the fire. Bring to a boil, and stir in three ounces of
butter, adding it little by little. Season with salt and pepper, and if too thick
add a little bouillon. Serve separate, some small squares of bread fried in
butter.</p>

<p><b>Crab ravigote.</b> Mix the meat of one boiled crab with a cup of Tartar
sauce and a little Cayenne pepper. With this fill four Eastern crab shells.
These shells are smaller and daintier than the Pacific Coast variety, and can
be obtained from first-class grocers. Sprinkle the tops with finely chopped
parsley, then lay a band of pimento across the center, parallel this with chopped
yolk of egg on one side, and with chopped whites on the other, and fringe the
whole with chopped parsley. Serve with quartered lemon and parsley.</p>

<p><b>Fillet of bass, Duglère.</b> On a buttered platter put four fillets of bass,
and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with a half of an onion, chopped
fine, and a little chopped parsley, tarragon and chervil. Peel and chop two
tomatoes and spread over the top of the fish. Put around the platter a little
brown gravy and one-half glass of white wine. A spoonful of meat extract
diluted with warm water may be used in place of the gravy if desired. Put a
small piece of butter on top of each fillet, then place the platter in a moderate
oven and bake for about thirty-five minutes. Serve on the same platter.</p>

<p><b>Rack of lamb, Montjo.</b> Roast a rack of lamb, and serve with sauce Madère,
to which has been added a can of French mushrooms and some stuffed
olives.</p>

<p><b>Omelet with cèpes.</b> Melt two ounces of butter in an omelet pan, then
add a can of sliced cèpes, season with salt and pepper, and fry them. Then
add twelve beaten eggs, and make the omelet. Pour some brown gravy
around the omelet. Cream or tomato sauce may be used, if desired.</p>

<p><b>Loin of lamb chops, jardinière.</b> Season four lamb chops with salt and
pepper, roll in oil, and broil. Then place on a platter, cover with Madeira
sauce, and garnish with bouquets of fresh vegetables; such as peas in butter,
cauliflower Hollandaise; or asparagus tips, string beans, young carrots, etc.
Also add some kind of potatoes.</p>

<p><b>Consommé Valentienne.</b> Make some small dumplings of cream puff paste
and boil in salt water for two minutes. Cook some lettuce, cut Julienne style,
in consommé. Boil some Italian paste. Serve equal parts of each in boiling
consommé.</p>

<p><b>Suggestions and recipes for preserves, jellies and pickles.</b> For jelly select
your fruit before it is too ripe, as the flavor will then be much better. Put it
on the stove and bring to a heat, to facilitate the easy extraction of the juice.
Have a funnel-shaped bag made of flannel, to strain the juice through. The
first time it is strained use a wire sieve with a revolving wire to crush the
fruit. The juice should always be strained twice, and the second time if the
flannel bag is used, and it is allowed to hang over night and drip, it will be
much clearer. Put on the juice over a good fire and allow it to come to a
heat, then add the sugar, which should be first heated in the oven. Boil
rapidly in a pan with a very large bottom, so that as much surface can be on
the stove as possible. If it is desired that the color be light add a little gelatine.
From fifteen to twenty minutes is long enough to boil it, but it should not
stop boiling during this time. Better success will probably be had if the jelly
is cooked in small quantities. After pouring the jelly in glasses set in the hot
sun until set, and then cover with melted paraffine.</p>

<p>If corn starch be put in the juice before adding the sugar it will make it
clearer. Use two teaspoonfuls in two tablespoonfuls of water, to three pints
of juice. A teaspoonful of sugar on top of jelly, in the glass, prevents moulding.
(To one pint of juice 1½ lbs. sugar).</p>

<p><b>Preserves.</b> Small stone jars are best for preserves. If glass jars are
used they should be wrapped in paper to exclude the light. To prevent preserves
from sugaring add a little tartaric acid after they are cooked.</p>

<p><b>Pickles.</b> Cider vinegar is best for pickles. If vinegar is too strong dilute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
it with water. The pickles should be tightly sealed to prevent the air reaching
the vinegar, as this kills it. The vinegar should always be poured on hot,
just as it comes to the first scald&mdash;never allowing it to boil.</p>

<p>Never put up pickles in anything that has held grease; and never let
them freeze. If pickles are put into brine it should be strong enough to bear
an egg. To make the brine, use a heaping pint of salt to each gallon of water.
Put the pickles in bottles, and seal while the brine is hot. A half bushel of
grape leaves added to the barrel of salt pickles will keep them sound and firm.
A slice of horseradish added to each jar or bottle of vinegar pickles will keep
the vinegar clear.</p>

apples, four quarts of cane sugar. Boil for twenty-five or thirty minutes.</p>

<p><b>Raspberry or loganberry jam.</b> In making raspberry jam, if two-thirds
red raspberries and one-third currants are used the jam will be better, as the
berries alone do not contain enough acid. Loganberries are sufficiently acid.
Mash the fruit well, and boil it for twenty minutes. Weigh, and to every
pound of fruit use three-quarters of a pound of sugar. Boil until when some
is placed on a saucer no juice will gather around it. Put in small jars or
glasses, in the same manner as jelly.</p>

<p><b>Canned strawberries.</b> Wash well before hulling. Weigh, and to each
pound of berries add one-quarter pound of cane sugar. Boil for fifteen minutes.
Put in pint jars and seal while hot.</p>

<p><b>Apple jelly.</b> Take ripe Belleflower, or other fine-flavored cooking apples.
Cut in quarters and remove the cores. Drop in water as fast as cut, to prevent
them from turning black. Add a little lemon juice to the water. When all
are ready drain off the water, and put the apples in a copper preserving kettle.
Pour a little water over them and cook until soft, then strain through a flannel
bag. Boil the juice with an equal weight of sugar, until it jells, and pour
while hot into jelly glasses.</p>

<p><b>Blackberry jelly.</b> Heat the berries to the boiling point, mash, and strain
through a flannel bag. Add an equal weight of sugar to the juice, and boil
briskly for twenty-five minutes. Pour into glasses while hot.</p>

four red peppers (pimentos) stuffed with purée of sweet potatoes.</p>

<p><b>Cottage cheese.</b> Let two quarts of milk become sour. Put in a cheese

<p><b>Scrambled eggs, Marseillaise.</b> Peel and slice two fresh tomatoes and put
in casserole with two ounces of butter. Simmer for five minutes. Rub the
inside of a bowl with garlic, break twelve eggs in the bowl and beat them.
Add salt and pepper and half a cup of cream, pour into the casserole and
scramble in the usual manner.</p>

<p><b>Cream soup, à l'Algérienne.</b> Boil two sweet potatoes, and force through
a fine sieve. Add two quarts of cream of chicken soup. If too thick add a
little plain chicken broth, or boiling milk, season well, and strain. Before
serving add two cups of boiled rice.</p>

<p><b>Sole, Colbert.</b> Cut off the head of a large sole, and pull off the black skin.
Lift off the four fillets complete, spreading the two sides apart with two toothpicks,
so they will not touch. Dip in milk, then in flour, and then in beaten
eggs and fresh bread crumbs, the lower side only. Dip the top side in milk
and flour. Season well with salt and pepper, and place in a pan with butter,
and two ounces of butter on top of the fish. Bake in the oven, basting continually
until done. Then put the sole on a platter, remove the toothpicks
and fill the space with two ounces of butter that has been mixed with salt,
pepper, a little chopped parsley, one spoonful of meat extract, and the juice
of one lemon. Place the platter in the oven just long enough to melt the
butter. Garnish with parsley in branches and lemons cut in half. The whole
sole may be fried in swimming lard instead of baking, if desired. This way is
easier, but is not the correct one.</p>

<p><b>Filet mignon, Chéron.</b> Sprinkle four small tenderloin steaks with salt
and pepper, roll in oil, and broil; or sauté in pan with butter. Place on a
platter, cover with Béarnaise sauce, lay a slice of truffle on top of each, and
have for each fillet one artichoke bottom filled with macédoine of vegetables.</p>

<p><b>Victoria punch.</b> Two pounds of sugar, two quarts of water, and the juice
of six oranges, mixed. Then add a small glass of rhum, a small glass of kirsch,
and a glass of sauternes. Freeze. Serve in glasses, covered with a meringue
made with the white of three eggs and one-half pound of sugar.</p>

sauté pan, season with salt and pepper, add one-half glass of white wine,
cover with buttered manilla paper, and bake in the oven for fifteen minutes.
Then place the fish on a platter, put in the sauté pan one pint of white wine
sauce, and simmer for a few minutes. Then add two spoonfuls of green coloring,
and strain over fish.</p>

<p><b>Sauce Venitienne.</b> Use any kind of white meat or fish sauce, depending
upon what it is to be used with, and color with green vegetable coloring. Use
enough color to make the sauce bright green.</p>

<p><b>Soufflé glacé (plain).</b> Whip a pint of rich cream. Beat the yolks of four
eggs with one-quarter pound of sugar, until very light, then add the cream
to it. Beat the whites of five eggs very stiff, and add to the cream. Put into
fancy paper cases, specially made for this purpose, and freeze in the ice cream
box. If you have no ice cream box, put them in a thin vessel, cover tightly,
and pack in cracked ice with rock salt mixed with it.</p>

<p><b>Poached eggs, Blanchard.</b> Cut two English muffins in half, toast them,
and lay a slice of broiled ham on each. Put a poached egg on top of the ham,
and cover with cream sauce.</p>

<p><b>Cream of parsnips, II.</b> Put three pounds of veal bones in a casserole,
add three quarts of water and a handful of salt, bring to a boil, and skim.
Then add six sliced parsnips and a bouquet garni, and boil for an hour; then
remove the bones and the bouquet. Put three ounces of butter in another
vessel, heat, then add three spoonfuls of flour, and when hot add the broth
and parsnips. Boil for half an hour, then strain through a fine sieve, put
back in the casserole, season with salt and pepper, and add a pint of boiling
cream.</p>

<p><b>Fillet of bass, Argentina.</b> Put two ounces of butter in a casserole, add
a sliced onion and a sliced carrot, and simmer until done. Then add a can
of sliced French mushrooms, one-half can of sliced pimentos, four peeled and
sliced tomatoes, one cupful of tomato sauce, and a little salt and pepper. Boil
for ten minutes. Place four fillets of bass in a buttered pan, season with salt
and pepper, cover with the above sauce, and bake in oven until done. Serve
the fish from a platter with the sauce over it.</p>

<p><b>Cranberry jelly.</b> To three quarts of cranberries add two pounds of granulated
sugar and one quart of water. Cook thoroughly, and force through a
fine sieve. Cook the juice for fifteen minutes, and then pour into individual
moulds.</p>

<p><b>Crab apple jelly, and marmalade.</b> To eight quarts of crab apples add
three quarts of water. Boil slowly for an hour, adding more water to make
up for evaporation. Strain through a flannel bag, but do not squeeze. Measure
the juice and add an equal amount of sugar. Boil for twenty minutes, pour
into glasses, and seal when cold. Make a marmalade of the remainder of
the apples left in the bag, by pressing through a sieve, and then adding an
equal amount of cane sugar. Cook until well done. Flavor with lemon or
cinnamon.</p>

<p><b>Apricot and peach marmalade.</b> Cut some firm ripe apricots in half and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
remove the stones. Add a few spoonfuls of water and cook until soft. Strain
through a sieve, and add three-quarters of a pound of cane sugar to every
pound of fruit. Crack some of the stones and add the kernels to the fruit.
Continue to stir and cook until it thickens. Then pour immediately into hot
glasses. Allow to become thoroughly cold before covering. Peach marmalade
may be prepared in the same manner.</p>

<p><b>Brandied cherries.</b> Select some fine Queen Anne cherries and cut off
about half of the stem with scissors. Arrange the cherries in glass jars or
bottles. Melt two and one-half pounds of granulated cane sugar with a very
little water, being very careful not to let it scorch. Remove from the fire and
add half a vanilla bean, then add slowly one gallon of brandy. When cold
pour over the cherries, seal well, and keep in a cool place.</p>

<p><b>Brandied peaches.</b> Rub some sound white peaches with a crash towel
to remove the down. Prick all over with a needle, drop in cold water, drain,
put in a kettle, cover with fresh cold water, and add a small piece of alum
the size of a hazelnut. Place over a fire, stir occasionally, and as they float
to the surface of the liquid take them out and place in a pan of cold water.
Drain, and arrange in quart glass jars. Pour over brandy enough to cover the
peaches.</p>

<p>Seal and put away in a cool place, and let stand for two weeks. Then
drain off brandy into a kettle, and allow three pounds of sugar to each
gallon of brandy. Stir well to melt the sugar. Pour this over the peaches,
seal hermetically, and put away in a cool place.</p>

<p><b>Preserved cherries.</b> To each pound of stoned cherries allow one pound
of granulated cane sugar. Crack some of the stones and tie the kernels in
a piece of gauze, so they may be removed after the boiling. Then put all in
a preserving kettle, boil, and skim, until the syrup is clear. Then put the
cherries in jars; boil the syrup a little longer, and pour over the fruit.</p>

<p><b>Preserved green gage plums.</b> Use a pound of sugar for each pound of
plums. Have the fruit clean and dry, and prick all over to keep the skins
from breaking. Melt the sugar with as little water as possible, and when
boiling add the plums, a layer at a time. Boil for a few minutes, then lift out
with a skimmer and place singly on a dish to cool. Continue in this way
until the plums are removed. When the last layer is finished return the first
ones cooked to the kettle, and continue in reverse order, and boil until transparent.
Then take out and arrange closely in glass jars. When all are in the
jars pour the hot syrup over them, and seal.</p>

<p><b>Shirred eggs, Amiral.</b> Put two eggs in a buttered shirred egg dish and
cook. When nearly done put on top a spoonful of white wine sauce with a
little chopped lobster, mushrooms and truffles in it. Finish cooking, and
season well with salt and pepper.</p>

<p><b>Purée of cucumbers.</b> Peel four cucumbers, and cut in slices. Put them
in a casserole with two quarts of cold water, season with salt, and bring to
a boil. Then drain off the water, cool in cold fresh water, and drain again.
Put three ounces of butter in a casserole, add the cucumbers, cover, and
simmer in the oven for thirty minutes. Then remove from oven, set on top
of range, add three spoonfuls of flour, simmer, then add one quart of boiling
milk and one quart of chicken broth, and boil for twenty minutes. Strain
through a fine sieve, put back in casserole, season with salt, pepper and a
pinch of sugar, add two ounces of sweet butter and a cupful of heated cream.
When butter is melted add some bread that has been cut in small squares and
fried in butter, and serve.</p>

<p><b>Italian meringue.</b> Put one pound of sugar and one gill of water into a
copper kettle (copper inside and out) and cook to a blow. (See below). Beat
six whites of eggs very hard and dry, and then pour into the cooked sugar,
stirring constantly, and beat well until cold. It will then be a very smooth
meringue paste, which can be used for meringue with whipped cream, or
sherbet, or to make small fancy cakes, or for use in decorating cakes, pies,
tarts, etc.</p>

<p><b>How to cook sugar to a blow.</b> Dissolve one pound of sugar in one gill
of water, and put on fire to cook. After about five minutes of good boiling
dip a skimmer into it and remove immediately. Let the syrup drain a little,
and then blow through. If small air bubbles fly out the sugar is cooked to
a blow. If no air bubbles fly continue cooking until they do. It may possibly
require some time to get it right.</p>

<p><b>Peas à la Française.</b> In a casserole put two ounces of butter and a head
of lettuce sliced very fine. Simmer for five minutes, then add two pounds of
shelled peas, six small raw French carrots and one dozen raw fresh asparagus
tips. Season with salt and a pinch of sugar, add one pint of chicken broth,
cover, and simmer for one hour. Serve with fresh-chopped chervil on top.</p>

one pony of water, one-half teaspoonful of soda, six ounces of finely-chopped
almonds, one pinch of cloves and allspice, three-quarters of a pound of flour,
and two ounces of lemon and orange peel chopped fine. Boil the sugar, honey
and water; then take off the fire and allow to cool to blood heat; then mix
in the flour, spices, and the soda dissolved in a little water; then add the almonds
and the peel. Roll out about one-half inch thick, and cut in small
cakes about one inch by three; and bake in a moderate oven. When done

<p><b>Poached eggs, Créole.</b> Put some boiled rice on a platter, lay four poached
eggs on top, and cover with Créole sauce.</p>

<p><b>Lamb chops, Robinson.</b> Broil eight lamb chops, and lay them on a platter.
Clean a dozen chicken livers, cut in four, season with salt and pepper, put
in a frying pan with two ounces of hot melted butter, and sauté for three
minutes. Then sprinkle with a spoonful of flour, add a cup of bouillon or
broth, boil for a minute, add a little dry sherry wine, and pour over the chops.</p>

<p><b>Corn sauté in butter.</b> Cut the corn from eight ears, put in a sauté pan
with two ounces of butter, season with salt and pepper, and cook for ten
minutes.</p>

<p><b>Orange compote.</b> Take the outside yellow skin from six oranges cut
very fine in Julienne style. Cook for thirty minutes in water, changing about
three times. Changing the water takes away the bitter taste. Now peel the
fine skin of the six oranges very clean, and cut in two, crosswise. In a sauce
pan put one pound of sugar, a gill of water, and a drop of red coloring, and
boil for ten minutes. Add the cooked skins to the syrup and boil again for
fifteen minutes. Put the oranges in a deep bowl and pour the syrup over them.</p>

well, and dry with a towel. Season with salt and pepper, roll in oil, and broil.
When done place on four pieces of buttered toast, pour a cup of maître d'hôtel
sauce over it, and garnish with watercress and two lemons cut in half.</p>

<p><b>Snails (cake).</b> Take some German coffee cake dough and roll out into
a square sheet, about one-quarter inch thick. Brush over with melted butter,
and spread with some currants, citron chopped fine, sugar and cinnamon.
Roll the sheet of dough into a roll, and cut in slices about one-quarter inch
thick. Lay them on a buttered pan and allow to raise until nearly double
in size. Bake in moderate oven, and when done, and still hot, coat over with
thin lemon icing.</p>

boiled rice, and serve.</p>

<p><b>Fillet of bass, Brighton.</b> Place four fillets of bass in a buttered pan,
season with salt and pepper, add one-half glass of white wine, cover with
buttered paper, and set in oven for five minutes. Then place the fillets on a
platter; and put what remains in the pan in a casserole, add one pint of well-seasoned
sauce Italienne, bring to a boil, and pour over the fish. Sprinkle
with grated cheese, put small bits of butter on top, and bake in oven for fifteen
minutes. Sprinkle with fresh-chopped parsley and the juice of a lemon.</p>

<p><b>Fillet of fish au gratin, à l'Italienne.</b> Use any kind of fish cut in fillets;
large fish cut in slices; or whole small fish. Prepare in the same manner as
Fillet of Bass, Brighton.</p>

<p><b>Cold stuffed eggs, with anchovies.</b> Boil six eggs until hard, remove the
shells, and cut in two lengthwise. Pass the yolks through a fine sieve, and
mix with one dozen anchovies in oil cut in small squares, a little pepper,
and a teaspoonful of mayonnaise sauce. Fill the whites of the eggs with this
mixture, and serve on a napkin with parsley in branches and two lemons
cut in four.</p>

<p><b>Boiled farina in milk.</b> Bring a quart of milk to a boil, add a small pinch
of salt, and pour a half pound of farina into it slowly so dough balls will not
form. Cook for fifteen minutes.</p>

<p><b>Scrambled eggs, Caroline.</b> Cut two boiled artichoke bottoms and two
slices of boiled ham in small squares. In a casserole put the ham with two
ounces of butter, heat, and then add ten beaten eggs, season with salt and
pepper, add one-half cup of cream, and scramble in the usual manner. Just
before finishing add the artichokes.</p>

<p><b>Consommé, Niçoise.</b> To consommé vermicelli add a peeled tomato cut
in small squares. Bring to a boil, and serve with grated cheese, separate.</p>

<p><b>Watermelon preserves.</b> Select a melon with a thick rind, and cut in
any shape desired. Lay the pieces in strong salt water for two or three days;
then soak in clear water for twenty-four hours, changing the water frequently.
Then put in alum water for two hours to harden. To every pound of fruit
use one pound of sugar. Make a syrup of the sugar and a few pieces of ginger
root and one lemon sliced thin. After boiling for a few minutes, remove the
lemon and ginger, add the melon, and boil until transparent. Lift carefully,
and place in glass jars. Fill the jars with the syrup.</p>

<p><b>Canned pears.</b> Peel, halve and core ten pounds of pears. Put in a vessel
with five pounds of granulated sugar, one sliced lemon, one teaspoonful of
ground cinnamon, a little grated nutmeg, and a small piece of ginger root.
Tie the cinnamon and nutmeg loosely in a piece of gauze. Cook all together
until the pears turn pink. Put in jars, and seal while still hot.</p>

<p><b>Canned peaches.</b> Pare twelve pounds of peaches, cut in half, and lay in
cold water until needed. Put on the stove three pounds of sugar with nine
pints of water. Boil to a syrup. Set the jars on a cloth in hot water. Fill the
jars with the cold peaches, putting a generous layer of sugar between them.
When the jars are full fill up with the hot syrup, and seal immediately. Twelve
pounds of fruit and three pounds of sugar will fill six quart jars.</p>

<p><b>Canned apples and quinces.</b> Pare and cut equal quantities of apples and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
quinces. First cook the quinces in just sufficient water to cover. Then remove,
and cook the apples in the same water. In a vessel put a layer of
quinces, then a layer of apples, and so on until all are used. Pour over them
a syrup made of half a pound of sugar for each pound of fruit; and allow to
stand over night. Then boil for five minutes, and seal in jars.</p>

<p><b>Tomato preserves.</b> Scald and peel carefully some small, pear-shaped, half
ripe tomatoes. Prick with a needle to prevent their bursting, and put their
weight in sugar over them. Let them set overnight, then pour off the liquid
into a preserving kettle, and boil until it is a thick syrup. Clarify with the
white of an egg, add the tomatoes, and boil until transparent. A small piece
of ginger root; or a lemon sliced very thin, to each pound of fruit, and cooked
in the syrup, improves it.</p>

<p><b>Apple butter.</b> To three gallons of cooked apples add one quart of cider,
five pounds of brown sugar, and several sticks of cinnamon. Boil down to
about two gallons.</p>

cup of stock, bouillon or chicken broth. In another frying pan put a spoonful
of olive oil, heat, then add a can of cèpes, toss them while cooking slightly,
and add to the chicken. Peel one tomato, cut in eight, and also add to the
chicken. Simmer together for twenty minutes. Then place the chicken on

<p><b>Shirred eggs with peppers.</b> Cut four whole green peppers in small
squares. Take four individual shirred egg dishes and put a teaspoonful of
butter in each. Divide the chopped peppers equally among the four dishes,

with salt and a little pepper, and cook again until the eggs are done.</p>

<p><b>Beef marrow, Princess.</b> Have the butcher take the marrow out of four
beef shin bones. Lay them whole in cold water for an hour, so the blood will
run out. Then put the marrow in a casserole, in two quarts of cold water;
add a tablespoonful of salt, bring to a boil, and let the marrow stand for half
an hour in the boiling water. Then place it on four pieces of dry toast, and
cover with well-seasoned Bordelaise sauce. When making the Bordelaise
sauce omit the marrow.</p>

<p><b>Bread custard pudding.</b> Over half a pound of bread crumbs pour a

<p><b>Grapefruit, Cardinal.</b> Peel four grapefruit and slice them. Drain off
the juice, and put the slices in suprême glasses. Force two small baskets of
fresh raspberries through a fine sieve, put in a bowl, add two spoonfuls of
powdered sugar and one pony of kirschwasser, mix well, and pour over the
grapefruit.</p>

<p><b>Cold pheasant pie.</b> Cut the breasts from two pheasants, and trim carefully.
Put all of the trimmings and the meat of the legs without the bones,
in an earthern jar; add three chopped shallots, and a bouquet garni, cover
with sherry wine, and allow to stand for two days. Simmer the bones, with
an onion, carrot, and a little celery, in two ounces of butter, until slightly
brown. Then cover with a quart of stock, and cook slowly until reduced
one-half. Keep this to mix with the forcemeat. Pass through a fine meat
chopper one pound of veal, and one pound of not-too-fat pork; and season
with salt, pepper and a little allspice. Have a special game pie or Pâté form
lined with pâte dough. Put a layer of forcemeat in the bottom, then a few
pieces of the breasts cut in long narrow strips, and a strip of larding pork cut
the same size. Lay the strips lengthwise of the pie. Add a few peeled
blanched or parboiled pistachio nuts, then another layer of forcemeat, and so
continue until the form is full. Cover the top with thin layer of larding pork,
and then cover all with dough. Moisten the edges where the dough comes
together, and close carefully, so there will be no leak. Cut a round hole in
the center and insert a little chimney made of a small piece of stiff paper;
otherwise the dough will close while cooking. Put in the oven and cook for
one and one-half hours. Then allow to become cold, remove the paper chimney,
fill the hole with meat jelly, and put in ice box until set. Cut in thin slices.</p>

<p><b>Pâte dough.</b> One pound of flour, one-quarter pound of butter, three eggs,
one-half pony of water. Mix the butter and flour between the hands, then
add the eggs and water, and season with a little salt. Let the dough set in
the ice box a few hours before using.</p>

<p><b>Potage Dagobert.</b> Mix one quart of purée of peas, one pint of consommé
Julienne, and one pint of consommé aux perles de Nizam.</p>

<p><b>Tournedos, Porte Maillot.</b> Season four small tenderloin steaks with salt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
and pepper; roll in oil, and broil. Place on a platter, and garnish with carrots
and turnips cut in small balls, boiled and tossed in butter, salt and pepper.
Also four potatoes cut in the shape of wooden shoes, fried in hot swimming
lard, and filled with purée of spinach. Pour sauce Madère over the meat.</p>

<p><b>Fillet of sole, à la Française.</b> Lay four fillets of sole flat on a table, spread
with fish forcemeat (see <a href="#Page_42">Timbale of bass</a>), roll up and place in a buttered pan.
Season with salt and white pepper, add one-half glass of white wine and
one-half cup of fish stock, bouillon or water. Cover with buttered paper, and
set in oven for fifteen minutes. Then take out and place the fillets on a platter.
Add to the pan one pint of white wine sauce, boil for two minutes, and strain.
Then add to the sauce a spoonful of well-seasoned lobster butter, one dozen
French mushrooms, and two sliced truffles. Pour the sauce over the fish,
and garnish with four écrevisses en buisson.</p>

<p><b>Canapé St. Francis.</b> Put four nice leaves of yellow lettuce on four dessert
plates. Cut four round pieces of toast, two and one-half inches in diameter,
spread with fresh caviar, and place on top of the lettuce. Peel two ripe tomatoes
and cut in four nice slices, and lay on top of the caviar. Sprinkle each

<p><b>Calf's foot jelly.</b> Parboil four calf's feet; allow to become cool; put back
in vessel with an onion and a carrot, a piece of leek, a piece of celery, one
clove, a bay leaf, a sprig of thyme, a spoonful of whole black peppers, a gallon
of water, a quart of white wine, and a small handful of salt. Boil until the
feet are soft. Then strain the broth, let it stand for a couple of minutes, and
then remove all the fat from the top. Put a spoonful of the broth on a plate
and set on ice. If it sets too hard add a little water, if it is too soft boil down
until it is thick enough to set. Then put six whites of eggs in a casserole, beat
with a whip, add slowly to the broth, put on a slow fire and bring to the
boiling point. This serves to clarify the broth. Then strain, and set to cool.
If the broth is for invalids omit the spices and vegetables, use but a little
salt, and do not clarify. The cooked calf's feet may be used for an entrée, or
for soup or salad.</p>

<p><b>Eggs, Moscow.</b> Poach six eggs, and set in ice box until cold. Then remove
the yolks carefully by making a very small hole, and letting the soft
yolks run out. Fill the eggs with fresh caviar, roll in flour, then in beaten
eggs, and finally in bread crumbs; fry in very hot swimming lard or melted
butter for a few seconds only; or until the crumbs are yellow. Serve immediately
on a napkin, with fried parsley, and two lemons cut in half.</p>

<p><b>Terrine de foie gras en aspic.</b> Use a jelly mould that will contain as
much as six small individual moulds. Put a little melted, but not hot, meat
jelly in the bottom, and set on cracked ice until it is firm. Cut some foie gras
from a terrine with a spoon, and lay in the mould, then cover with a little
more melted jelly, then another layer of foie gras, and so continue until the
mould is full. Set in the ice box for an hour; and serve on a napkin, with
parsley in branches.</p>

<p><b>Consommé Palestine.</b> Add to hot well-seasoned consommé equal parts
of peas, flageolet beans, and carrots and turnips cut in small round balls; and
all boiled in salted water.</p>

<p><b>Brésilienne salad.</b> One-third boiled fresh Lima beans, one-third sliced
green peppers, and one-third celery cut Julienne style. Place in a salad bowl,

<p><b>Roast tenderloin of beef, Berthieu.</b> Garnish the roasted tenderloin with
stuffed cucumbers, stuffed olives, peas au beurre, and potatoes château. Serve
sauce Madère separate.</p>

<p><b>Potage Lord Mayor.</b> Put two pounds of veal bones in a roasting pan
with one onion, one carrot, a little celery, leek and parsley in branches, and
two ounces of butter. Roast in oven until nicely browned, then drain off the
fat, put in casserole, add two fresh pig's feet, one soup hen, and three pounds
of shin of beef, one bouquet garni, a handful of salt, and two gallons of water.
Cook until the hen and beef are soft, when they may be removed. When the
pig's feet are done take out the bone, the fat and the lean meat, so nothing
is left but the skin. Cut the skin in small squares, or round pieces the size
of a dime. Cut some carrots in the same shape, and boil in salted water until
soft. Put one pound of chopped beef in a casserole, add the whites of six eggs,
stir well, add slowly the strained broth, and bring to a boil. This will clarify it.
Season with salt and Cayenne pepper to taste. Boil for fifteen minutes, strain
through a cheese cloth into another pot, bring to a boil, and reduce slowly for
half an hour. Mix two spoonfuls of arrow root and a cup of sherry wine
well together, and let run slowly into the boiling broth. Boil again for ten
minutes. Before serving add a glass of dry amontillado. The beef and the
soup hen then may be used for salads, croquettes, or other purposes.</p>

<p><b>Eggs, Bienvenue.</b> Butter four individual shirred egg dishes. Make a
border of mashed (croquette) potato around each dish. Put in the bottom a
spoonful of purée of fresh tomatoes. Break two eggs in each dish, season
with salt and pepper, and bake in oven.</p>

<p><b>Kalter aufschnitt.</b> Assorted cold meats, such as roast beef, ham, tongue,
lamb, etc. Garnish with a lettuce leaf filled with potato salad, for each person.</p>

<p><b>Chicken mulligatawney soup.</b> Cut the breast from an uncooked soup
hen, and cut in small squares of about one-quarter inch. Make about two
quarts of broth from the bones and trimmings. Heat three ounces of butter
in a casserole, add the cut-up breast of chicken, and simmer for five minutes.
Then add an onion chopped very fine, and simmer again until yellow. Then
add two spoonfuls of flour and one spoonful of curry powder, and heat through.
Now pour in the strained chicken broth and a cup of rice, and boil slowly
until the rice is cooked. Cut two apples in quarter inch squares, and simmer
in butter until cooked, and add to the soup. Season with salt and pepper.</p>

<p><b>To preserve limes.</b> Remove the cores from the limes with a small tin
tube made for the purpose. Then cover with salad water, using a large handful
of salt to the gallon. Soak for four or five hours; then drain off the water,
and throw the limes into boiling water. As soon as they are soft take them
out, one by one, and drop them into cold water. Change the cold water several
times. To turn the limes green again put two gallons of water in a copper
pan, add two large handfuls of cooking salt, one cup of vinegar, and several
handfuls of fresh spinach. Put the pan on the fire and boil for a few minutes,
then put the limes in the pan, and boil up several times. Remove from the
fire, and allow to stand until cold; when the limes will have resumed their
natural color. Drain off the liquid and let the limes soak in fresh water for
about fourteen hours, changing the water frequently. Prepare a fifteen degree
syrup, testing with a syrup gauge or cooking thermometer; and when boiling
throw the limes into this, boil up, and then put into a vessel and leave for
twelve hours. Then pour off the syrup, and boil it to sixteen degrees, pour
it over the limes again, leaving it for twelve hours. Then drain and boil
again to twenty degrees, pour over the limes, stand for twelve hours, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
continue every twelve hours until thirty-two degrees are reached. Then boil
for two minutes, and pour into small stone jars. Seal hermetically when cool.</p>

<p><b>Jellied cherries.</b> Stone three pounds of cherries. Crush a handful of the
cherry stones, and tie in a gauze bag. Put a pound of currant juice on the fire,
add the crushed cherry stones, and steep. Put the cherries in a copper pan
over a slow fire, and reduce one-half. Then add three pounds of granulated
cane sugar and the currant juice, after the gauze bag has been removed; and
boil steadily until a little tried on a saucer will not spread. Add half a gill of
kirschwasser, and pour at once into jelly glasses. Place in a cool place, and
when cold pour melted paraffine over the top and cover tightly.</p>

<p><b>Candied lemon or orange peels.</b> Put a sufficient quantity of lemon or
orange peels on the fire with enough water to cover. Boil until soft to the
touch, then drain, and put in cold water and soak for twenty-four hours,
changing the water often. Then pour off the water, and put the peels in an
earthern jar, covering with a fifteen degree boiling syrup. Use a syrup gauge
or cooking thermometer to determine the density. Let the peels stand for
twelve hours, then pour off the syrup and boil it up to eighteen degrees.
Pour again over the peels and let it set for twelve hours. Repeat this operation
six or seven times, gradually increasing the density of the syrup until it
reaches thirty-two degrees. The last time prepare a fresh thirty-two degree
syrup. Drain the old syrup from the peels, add them to the fresh boiling
syrup, and boil up once. Then put the peels in stone jars or pots, cover with
the syrup, and seal when cold.</p>

<p><b>Fig jam.</b> Select large white firm figs, remove the stems, and cut in
quarters. Dissolve a half pound of sugar in a little water for each pound of
figs. Bring to a boil, then add the figs and boil steadily until the marmalade
coats the spoon and drops from it in beads. Then pour into hot jelly glasses.</p>

<p><b>Blackberry cordial, for medicinal purposes.</b> Heat and strain through
fine cheese cloth some ripe blackberries. To one pint of juice add one pound

ounce of mace, and one teaspoonful of cloves. Boil all together for twenty
minutes, strain, and to each pint add a jill of French brandy. Put up in
small bottles.</p>

<p><b>Vanilla brandy.</b> Cut some vanilla beans very fine, pound in a mortar,
put in bottles and cover with strong brandy. This is much better than
ordinary vanilla extract.</p>

three truffles cut in dices about one-eighth inch square. Heat through, and
then add eight beaten eggs, and one-half cup of cream. Season with salt and
pepper, then scramble, and dish up on a china platter. Cut about a dozen
slices of truffle, heat on a plate with the addition of half a spoonful of meat
extract, and lay over the eggs.</p>

<p><b>Galantine of capon.</b> Split open down the back a good-sized fowl or capon,
and remove every bone, being careful not to remove any of the meat, and not
to cut the skin. Lay out flat on the table skinside down, and season with salt
and pepper. Prepare a forcemeat with one pound of veal, and one and one-half
pounds of lean pork. Strain through a sieve, season with salt and pepper
and a little grated nutmeg, and add a pint of cream. Cut in small squares the
tip of a smoked boiled beef tongue, one-half pound of white fat pork, one-quarter
pound of ham, one-quarter pound of peeled pistache nuts, and four
truffles. Mix thoroughly with the force meat, and put on top of the fowl.
Close, by drawing both sides together, forming a big sausage. Roll very
tightly in a towel or napkin, and tie with a string on both ends and twice
around the middle. Cook in bouillon, stock or salted water slowly for from
one and one-half to two hours. When cooked, untie, remove the cloth, roll
tight again and re-tie. Set in the ice box for at least eight hours. Serve
sliced in the same manner as sausage, and about one-quarter inch thick. Garnish
with meat jelly and parsley in branches. Galantine of chicken, squab,
etc., may be prepared in the same manner.</p>

<p><b>Salade Cupid d'Azure.</b> Cut alligator pears in slices, lay on a platter, and
sprinkle with one chopped shallot, salt and pepper, one chopped green pepper,
one spoonful of vinegar, and two spoonfuls of olive oil. Allow to stand for
an hour. Cut two heads of well-washed romaine salad in two, and on each
lay a slice of grapefruit, then a slice of alligator pear, then a slice of grapefruit,
and so continue until the romaine is full. Divide the dressing over the
individual salads; and if not sufficient, finish with French dressing.</p>

<p><b>Consommé Trianon.</b> To each portion of consommé royal add six slices
of truffle cut in triangle shape.</p>

<p><b>Mustard sauce.</b> To one pint of cream sauce add two spoonfuls of French
mustard, and mix well.</p>

done. Then add two spoonfuls of flour and one spoonful of paprika, and
simmer again for a few minutes. Then add half a pint of stock, half a cup
of white wine, one spoonful of meat extract, and the veal. Season well with
salt, and simmer for twenty minutes. Should the sauce be too thick add a
little more stock.</p>

<p><b>Poached eggs, Bar le Duc.</b> Place four boiled bottoms of artichokes on
four pieces of toast, and lay four poached eggs on the artichokes. Cover all

in a vessel and bring to a boil. Then stir in slowly two tablespoonfuls of
flour, and continue stirring until there are no lumps. Mix this with the
écrevisse and lobster meat and mashed shells. When cold strain through a
very fine sieve. Place in a bowl on ice and mix with an egg and a pint of
thick cream; stirring in carefully so it does not curdle. Test for seasoning,
and if necessary add a little écrevisse coloring to give a rose shade. Fill small
buttered moulds, and boil in bain-marie for about fifteen minutes. Turn out
on a platter, and pour écrevisse sauce over all. The lobster is added for
economy and strength of color. Double the amount of écrevisses may be
used instead.</p>

<p><b>Écrevisse sauce.</b> Melt two tablespoonfuls of écrevisse butter in a pint
of sauce Allemande, or sauce au vin blanc. Add a few écrevisse tails.</p>

<p><b>Red cabbage salad.</b> Slice a head of red cabbage very thin, put in a salad
bowl, season with salt, pepper, one spoonful of oil, and three spoonfuls of

<p><b>Eggs à la Patti.</b> Make a chicken hash in cream and put on a platter.
Lay four poached eggs on top, and one slice of truffle on top of each egg.
Pour sauce Madère around the hash.</p>

<p><b>Puff paste roses.</b> Roll out some puff paste about one-eighth inch thick,
and cut with a star cutter. Brush over with a little water, and fold the points
of the stars to the center. Bake, and when nearly done dust with powdered
sugar, and return to oven to finish baking. The cakes will puff up like a
rose. Fill with jelly and serve.</p>

<p><b>Consommé Alexandria.</b> Add one cupful of boiled white meat of chicken,
cut in small dices, to three pints of consommé brunoise.</p>

<p><b>Orange or lemon brandy, for flavoring.</b> Peel very thin the yellow outside
from oranges or lemons. The inner white skin is not good. Crush with a
little granulated sugar. Put in a bottle and cover with strong brandy. In the
same manner can be prepared the kernels of cherries, plums, apricots or
peaches. Pound the kernels slightly before putting them in the brandy.</p>

<p><b>Glacé fruit.</b> Be very particular in selecting the fruit. Cherries should be
large and not quite ripe, and without blemishes; and the stones must be
removed. Apricots and peaches should be of medium size, and almost green.
Make as small a hole as possible when removing the stones. Pears should
be peeled, and the stems left on. Figs should be green. Strawberries should
be very green, but full grown; wash and dry well, and leave the stems on.
Nectarines should be green, and the stones removed. Any hard green plums
may be used, but leave their stones in. Cut pineapple in thick slices, remove
the core, and any brown outside spots. All fruit should be thoroughly washed
and dried before being prepared. It is well to make new syrup for each kind
of fruit. To make the syrup boil two pounds of granulated sugar and two
gills of water for eight minutes. Put the fruit in the syrup piece by piece;
do not let it stop boiling; and wait a few seconds between each piece, so the
syrup will boil up over the fruit. Then remove piece by piece in the same
order as placed in the kettle. Use a silver spoon or an aluminum skimmer to
handle the fruit, and under no circumstances use a fork. Place the fruit on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
a thick piece of waxed paper, and set in a cool place. Repeat the process the
next day, adding a pound of sugar and a gill of water to the syrup of the
day before. Allow the fruit to boil hard for a minute, and remove as before.
This must be continued for about eight days before the fruit will have absorbed
enough sugar, and not be mushy. When the fruit is finished line a
broad shallow stone jar with waxed paper, lay the fruit in singly, not allowing
the pieces to touch, put waxed paper between the layers, and cover closely.</p>

<p><b>Baked pears, for canning.</b> Wash as many ripe, firm unspecked pears as
will fill a baking pan. Fill the pan almost full of boiling water. Sweeten as
though for immediate use. Set the pan in the oven, baste frequently, and
turn the pears around so they will brown lightly and evenly. Add a few
cloves and a small stick of cinnamon. When the pears are very tender and
almost candied, pack in hot glass jars, and pour the boiling syrup over them.
Be sure to have enough thick syrup to cover the fruit. Seal while hot.
Should the water evaporate too much while cooking, add a little more from
time to time.</p>

<p><b>White bean salad.</b> Soak a pound of navy beans over night in cold water.
Then boil them in three quarts of water; to which has been added a little
salt, an onion, a carrot, and a bouquet garni. When soft, remove the onion
and carrot, and the bouquet garni, drain off the water, and set the beans to
cool. When cold put in a salad bowl, add two shallots chopped very fine,
a little chopped parsley, a little salt and some fresh-ground pepper, one spoonful
of vinegar and two of olive oil. Mix well.</p>

<p><b>Lamb broth à la Reine.</b> Put a shoulder of lamb in a roasting pan, season
with salt and pepper, a little fat or a small piece of butter, and put in the
oven to roast. When done remove the lean meat from the bones and cut in
small squares. Put the trimmings in a casserole with five pounds of lamb
bones and three quarts of water. Bring to a boil, skim well, and then add
one sliced onion, one carrot, a bay leaf, six cloves, a bouquet garni, a stalk
of leek and three leaves of celery, a little salt and a few whole black pepper
berries. Boil slowly for one hour, without being covered, so the broth will
stay clear. Strain through fine cheese cloth, add the lamb cut in small squares,
and one-half pound of boiled rice. Serve hot and well seasoned.</p>

<p><b>Pumpkin pie.</b> Make a custard with five eggs, two ounces of sugar, one
pint of pumpkin pulp, one pony of molasses, three ounces of melted butter,
one pinch of grated nutmeg, one pinch of cinnamon and one pinch of allspice.
Mix to a custard, and finish like a custard pie.</p>

<p><b>Pumpkin pulp.</b> Peel a pumpkin and wash out the seeds. Steam or boil
until soft, and strain through a fine sieve.</p>

<p><b>Baked whitefish, St. Menehould.</b> Take four pounds of whitefish (bass or
other fish may be used), put in a vessel with two quarts of water and a spoonful
of salt, and boil for five minutes. Then drain off the water, remove the
skin and bones, and break the fish in two inch pieces. Make one quart of
cream sauce. In a buttered baking dish put one spoonful of cream sauce,
then one-third of the fish; cover with cream sauce; then another third of the
fish; cover with sauce; and then the remainder of the fish, and pour the
remainder of the sauce on top. The sauce should be highly seasoned. Sprinkle
the top with grated Swiss or Parmesan cheese, put small bits of butter on top,
and bake in oven for fifteen or twenty minutes. Sprinkle with the juice of
two lemons, and serve from the baking dish.</p>

<p><b>Omelette Bayonnaise.</b> For four persons, take the bottoms of two boiled
artichokes and cut in squares. Add one-half can of French mushrooms, sliced.
Mix with a very little tomato sauce. Make the omelet, and before turning

cabbage to each person.</p>

<p><b>Stuffed cabbage.</b> May be made any size, using the whole cabbage; or as
small around as a silver half dollar, for garnishing. Parboil a whole cabbage;
or some leaves only. Make a stuffing as follows: Soak two rolls in milk for
ten minutes, then squeeze out, and chop fine. Add one onion, chopped and
fried in butter; one pound of sausage meat; a whole raw egg, and some chopped
parsley, chervil and chives. Season with salt and pepper, and mix well. Fill
the whole head of cabbage if desired. Or, take two leaves and season with salt
and pepper, put a spoonful of the stuffing in the center, and fold the leaves
in the form of a ball. Place the stuffed cabbage in a buttered pan with a sliced
carrot and onion, a bay leaf and a clove. Cover with bouillon, put a buttered
paper over the top of the pan, and cook in the oven until the cabbage is soft.

sauce.</p>

sauce: Cut a carrot and a turnip in very small dices, like brunoise, and
put in a casserole with one ounce of butter. Cover the casserole, and simmer
for twenty minutes or over, but be careful that it does not burn. Put two
ounces of butter in another casserole, add a spoonful of flour and the broth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
from the cooked sole. If too thick add a little fish stock. Boil for five minutes,
bind with the yolks of two eggs mixed with half a cup of cream, strain, and add
the carrots and turnips, from which the butter has been drained. Season well.</p>

<p><b>Colache (vegetable).</b> Pare three good-sized summer squash, and cut in
small squares; three peeled and quartered tomatoes, and the corn cut from
four ears. Put two ounces of butter in a casserole with one chopped onion,
and simmer until the onion is yellow. Then add the squash, corn and tomatoes,

platter, and lay six poached eggs on top.</p>

<p><b>Roast Muscovy duck.</b> Clean a Muscovy duck, season with salt and pepper,
and stuff with a piece of celery and two shallots chopped very fine. Put the
duck in a roasting pan with a sliced onion and carrot, add a little water, and
put in a hot oven. The water will evaporate quickly, and the fat from the duck
will be sufficient to roast it. Baste often. When done place the duck on a
platter, remove the fat from the pan, add one cup of stock and a spoonful of
meat extract, boil for five minutes, and pour over the duck.</p>

<p><b>Artichokes, Barigoule.</b> Parboil six artichokes in salted water for two
minutes. Then remove the hairy part, between the leaves and the bottoms;
and fill with a stuffing made as follows: Simmer twelve chopped shallots in a
casserole in two ounces of butter; then add one-half pound of chopped fresh
mushrooms, and simmer again for ten minutes. Then add one-half glass of
white wine, and boil until nearly dry, but be careful that it does not burn.
Then add one-half cup of brown gravy, season with salt and pepper and a little
chopped garlic and parsley, and boil for five minutes. Then thicken with the
yolks of three raw eggs, and if necessary add a very little fresh bread crumbs.
When the artichokes are filled tie a thin slice of salt pork over the tops, lay in
a sauté pan, with sliced onions, sliced carrots, a bouquet garni, and one-half
pint of bouillon. Cover, set in the oven and cook for about forty-five minutes.
If the leaves loosen easily they are done. Serve on a platter with sauce
Madère.</p>

<p><b>Fresh asparagus and Westphalia ham.</b> Boil some fresh asparagus, and
serve with Hollandaise sauce. Serve at the same time raw sliced Westphalian
ham.</p>

teaspoonfuls of baking powder, one-half teaspoonful of salt, and some sweet
milk. Sift the baking powder, salt and flour, four times. Add enough milk

There should be broth enough to cook up around the dumplings, but not
enough to cover them. Boil for half an hour, and do not lift the cover until
done.</p>

<p><b>Homemade clam soup.</b> Put three dozen Little Neck clams with their
juice in a sauce pan. Add one pint of cold water, bring to a boil, and skim
well. Then add one-half pint of boiling cream and two ounces of butter.
When the butter is melted add one cup of broken saltine crackers, and season
with salt, pepper, and a little chopped parsley.</p>

<p><b>Fillet of sole, Paul Bert.</b> Put four fillets of sole in a buttered pan, season
with salt and pepper, add one-half cup of fish stock, and one-half glass of
white wine, cover with a buttered paper, and cook for ten minutes. Place
fillets on a platter, reduce the stock nearly dry, add one cup of tomato sauce

<p><b>Omelet with peas.</b> Mix a cup of boiled peas with two spoonfuls of cream
sauce, and season with salt and a little sugar. Make an omelet with twelve
eggs, and before turning over on platter fill with the peas. Pour a thin cream
sauce around the omelet.</p>

<p><b>Sirloin steak, Saxonne.</b> Season two sirloin steaks with salt and pepper,
roll in oil, and broil. When done place on a platter, and garnish with four
stuffed tomatoes with rice, and four stuffed cucumbers (see <a href="#VEGETABLES">index</a>). Pour
a little sauce Madère over the steaks.</p>

<p><b>Consommé Medina.</b> Boil six chicken livers in bouillon. When done, cut
in Julienne style. Boil one-quarter pound of spaghetti until soft, cut in pieces
one inch long, and add with the chickens' livers, to one and one-half quarts
of very hot consommé. Serve grated cheese separate.</p>

<p><b>Pickled nasturtion seeds.</b> Select the small and green seeds, and put
them in salted water; changing the water twice in the course of a week.
Then pour off the brine and cover with scalding vinegar with a little alum
in it. Use in salads.</p>

<p><b>Pickled artichokes.</b> Select small and tender artichokes, trim the bottoms,
remove the hardest leaves, and allow to stand in alum water until ready to
cook. Then bring to the boiling point, and allow to become cool slowly.
Pack in glass jars, and cover with a liquor made as follows: To one gallon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
of vinegar add a teacup of sugar, one cup of salt, a teaspoonful of alum, and
one-quarter ounce of cloves and black pepper. Bring to the boiling point,
pour over the artichokes, and seal while hot.</p>

<p><b>Pickled onions.</b> Select very small white onions, peel them, and boil in
equal parts of sweet milk and water for ten minutes. Drain well, place in
glass jars, and pour scalding spiced vinegar over them immediately. Use no
sugar, and no allspice in the vinegar as it would tend to darken the onions.</p>

<p><b>Pickles.</b> Take one hundred green cucumbers two inches long, or under;
and peel as many small white onions as desired. Wash well, and put into a
stone jar. Sprinkle plenty of table salt over them, and toss all about with
the hands. Allow to stand for twenty-four hours, then drain off the liquor,
place the cucumbers and onions in glass jars, and cover with spiced vinegar
without sugar. Add a small red pepper to each jar. Seal hot.</p>

<p><b>Sweet pickled peaches.</b> Select clingstone peaches, and peel; or rub the
down off with a coarse crash towel. For eight pounds of fruit use four pounds
of sugar, one quart of vinegar, one ounce of stick cinnamon, and one ounce
of whole cloves. Boil the sugar and vinegar with the cinnamon for two minutes.
Stick one or two cloves in each peach, and put in the boiling syrup.
When the peaches are done place in jars, and put others in the syrup to cook
until all are done. Then reduce the syrup to half the original quantity, and
pour over the fruit. Seal hot. Plums and pears may be pickled in the same
manner.</p>

<p><b>Green tomato pickle.</b> Slice one peck of green tomatoes and one dozen
large onions very thin. Put the tomatoes in a jar with salt sprinkled between
layers, and allow to stand for a few hours. Put the onions in another jar,
pour boiling water over them, and allow them to stand for a few hours also.
Then squeeze the juice from both, and arrange them in a stone jar in alternate
layers, sprinkling through them celery and mustard seed. Pour over all a
quart of vinegar and a pint of sugar brought to a boil. It will be ready to use
when cold.</p>

<p><b>Ripe cucumber sweet pickles.</b> Pare twelve large ripe cucumbers, cut out
the pulp, and cut them in strips. Boil together two pounds of sugar, one pint of
vinegar, and one-half ounce of cinnamon and cloves. Skim well. Then put in
the cucumbers, and cook until tender. Then remove the cucumbers, reduce the
liquor, pour over the cucumbers, and cover tightly.</p>

<p><b>Shirred eggs, Brunswick.</b> Butter a shirred egg dish, lay a slice of raw
tomato about one-half inch thick in the bottom, heat through, turn it over, and
break two eggs on top. Season with salt and pepper, and finish cooking.</p>

<p><b>Potage Schorestène.</b> Chop fine, one pound of sirloin, or top sirloin, of
beef. Put in a casserole with three quarts of consommé and boil slowly for
one hour. Then strain through a coarse sieve. The meat must be all forced
through the sieve, and served in the soup.</p>

<p><b>Small tenderloin steak, Nicholas II.</b> Cut four small steaks, and season
with salt and pepper. Put two ounces of butter in a frying pan and fry the
steaks, and when nearly done remove them to a casserole. Heat eight whole
truffles in sherry wine, and use them to garnish the steaks. Also lay on each
steak a slice of goose liver sauté in butter. Pour a little sauce Madère over all.</p>

<p><b>Baked brown bread pudding.</b> One quart of graham bread crumbs, one
quart of milk, one gill of molasses, two ounces of butter, two ounces of sugar,
three eggs, and one-half teaspoonful of cinnamon. Make the crumbs very
fine. Then melt the butter in the milk, with the sugar, molasses, cinnamon,

one-half hour. Serve hot, with cream sauce flavored with a little cinnamon.</p>

<p><b>Sweet grape juice.</b> Crush twenty pounds of Concord grapes in three
quarts of water, and put them in a porcelain kettle. Set the kettle on the
fire, and stir well until it reaches the boiling point; then allow it to simmer
for fifteen or twenty minutes. Strain through a cloth, and add three pounds
of white sugar. When the sugar is dissolved strain again through a cloth,
and heat to the boiling point. Pour into hot pint or quart bottles, and seal
instantly with new corks, only. After the corks have been inserted dip the
necks of the bottles into hot sealing wax.</p>

<p><b>Canned pumpkin or squash.</b> Peel the squash or pumpkin, and cut in
small squares. Boil, without seasoning, until soft. Mash through a fruit
press. Fill hot quart glass jars, and seal tight. Keep in a cool dark place.</p>

<p><b>Preserved violets.</b> Cut the stems from one pound of large full-blown
violets. Boil one and one-half pounds of granulated sugar, until a little
dropped in cold water makes a soft ball. Then throw the violets into the
sugar, remove the pan from the fire for a moment, and stir gently. Then
return the pan to the fire, boil up once, and then change the violets immediately
to another vessel. Let them stand over night, and then drain off the
syrup through a sieve. Put the syrup in a copper pan, add a cupful of sugar,
and cook until it hardens in water. Then put in the violets, change to another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
vessel, and allow to stand again over night. Again drain off the syrup, and
boil it for a few minutes. Then add the violets, and remove the pan at once
from the fire, and stir lightly until it begins to crystalize. Then pour the
whole on sheets of paper, shake, and separate the flowers carefully with the
fingers. When dry pick them from the sugar, arrange on a wire grating, and
allow them to become cool.</p>

<p><b>Canned minced meat.</b> Three pounds of boiled beef, one pound of beef
suet, three pounds of brown sugar, one-half peck of apples, two pounds of
raisins, one pound of currants, one pound of citron, one grated nutmeg, one
tablespoonful of powdered mace, and allspice and cinnamon to suit the taste.
Chop the meat, suet and apples, slice the citron fine, and mix all together
with the seasoning. Pour on enough boiled cider to make a thick batter.
Heat it thoroughly and put into one quart glass jars. Seal while hot, and
set away in a cool dark place.</p>

<p><b>Broiled smoked Alaska black cod.</b> Get a kippered Alaska black cod, roll
in oil and broil. Serve with maître d'hôtel butter, and garnish with lemons
cut in half, and parsley in branches. This fish is excellent prepared in the
same manner as finnan haddie or smoked salmon, or served raw as a hors
d'oeuvre.</p>

<p><b>Eggs Argenteuil.</b> Scoop out the centers from four English muffins, toast
them, and place a poached egg in each, cover with sauce Hollandaise, and lay
two slices of truffle heated in butter on top of each.</p>

<p><b>Chicken hash, Italienne.</b> Put two ounces of butter in a sauté pan with
one chopped onion, or six chopped shallots. Fry, and then add one-half
spoonful of flour and cook until brown. Then add one glass of sherry wine,
and one cup of broth or stock, one whole boiled fowl cut in small dices, and
one pound of dried mushrooms that have been previously soaked in cold
water for one hour. Season with salt and pepper, and boil all together for
thirty minutes. Serve toast Melba separate.</p>

<p><b>Chicken soup à la Française.</b> Put a fat soup hen in a casserole with three
quarts of water, a little salt, one onion, one carrot, and a bouquet garni. When
coming to a boil skim well, cover, and simmer slowly until the hen is cooked.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
Then remove the hen and cut the meat in half inch squares. Strain the
broth, bring to a boil, and add two cupfuls of boiled rice and the chicken meat.
Season well with salt and pepper, and add some chopped chervil.</p>

<p><b>Merry widow cocktail.</b> Use wide glasses. Put in the bottom the tails
of six écrevisses, or crawfish. Lay six asparagus tips on top, season with salt
and pepper, and cover with plenty of mayonnaise. Set in the ice box as near
the ice as possible, to chill thoroughly.</p>

<p><b>Scallops à la poulette.</b> Parboil the scallops from two to three minutes
in their own juice, but not longer, as they will become tough and rubbery.
Drain, and keep the juice. Heat two spoonfuls of flour and two spoonfuls of
butter, and add the juice and a little stock, making a thin sauce. Season with
salt and pepper, add the yolk of one egg and two spoonfuls of cream, but do
not boil. Mix in the scallops, and serve. Oysters and clams may be prepared
in the same manner.</p>

<p><b>Cranberry water ice.</b> Cook the berries in a very small quantity of water
in a granite or porcelain lined kettle, as otherwise the berries will become
discolored. Then strain the cooked berries through a hair-sieve, making a
thin purée. To every quart of berries add the juice of two lemons. For each
quart of berries dissolve a pint of sugar in a cup of water, and add to the purée.
Taste to see if sweet enough. Freeze in the same manner as other water ices.
Serve as an ice, for dessert, or between courses; although the latter manner
of serving ices is going out of vogue.</p>

equal parts. Sprinkle with powdered sugar, and moisten with Dubonnet.
Serve in double suprême glasses with a few fresh strawberries on top.</p>

quarts of water, the rind of a lemon, one stick of cinnamon, one-half cup of
sugar, and a vanilla bean. Put on hot stove and bring to a boil. Then move
to one side of fire and simmer slowly for six hours. Or, set in a moderate
oven for six hours. Allow to become cool, and add a pony of good cognac.

<p><b>Canapé P. P. I. E.</b> (Panama-Pacific International Exposition). Make
some pieces of buttered toast. Put fresh caviar in the center and anchovies
around the edge. Serve on napkins with quartered lemons and parsley in
branches.</p>

<p><b>Oysters Bellevue.</b> In a lighted chafing dish put four pats of table butter,
one-half teaspoonful of English mustard, a little salt, pepper and celery salt.
Stir until the butter melts. Then add a teacupful of very finely chopped
celery, and stir well until the celery is nearly cooked. Then pour in slowly,
while stirring, one pint of rich cream, and allow to come to the boiling point.
Then put in a dozen freshly opened oysters and cook for four or five minutes.
Add a tablespoonful of good sherry or Madeira, and serve on very hot plates.</p>

<p><b>Spoon or mush bread.</b> Scald two cups of corn meal in two cups of boiling
water, allow to cool slightly, then add one cup of buttermilk, one teaspoonful
of soda, two tablespoonfuls of lard or butter (butter preferred), one egg, and
salt to taste. If you have no buttermilk use baking powder and sweet milk.</p>

<p><b>Corn pudding.</b> One quart of corn cut from the ear and chopped fine,
one egg, a tablespoonful of butter, and salt and pepper to taste. Thin with
sweet milk, and bake in a hot oven.</p>

<p><b>Sweet potato pudding.</b> Grate a large sweet potato and mix with one cup
of sugar, one-half cup of butter, and two or three eggs, according to the size
of the potato. Thin with sweet milk, flavor with ginger and spices, or vanilla
can be used. Beat the eggs well before adding to the mixture. Bake in a
moderate oven very slowly. The potatoes in the west are not as sweet as the
southern variety, therefore more sugar may be required. A good rule is to
bake a small portion first to see if the flavor is right. It is considered a luxury
in certain parts of the South.</p>

<p><b>Loganberry ice cream.</b> Put in a pan one quart of milk and one-half
pound of sugar, and place on the fire. Mix the yolks of sixteen eggs with
one-half pound of sugar. Stir the milk and sugar, after it has reached the
boiling point, into it. Replace on the fire and stir until it becomes creamy,
but do not let it boil. Then remove from the fire, add one quart of cream,
strain and freeze. When nearly frozen add one quart of bottled loganberry
juice, and finish freezing. A few drops of red coloring can be added
if a bright color is desired.</p>

in one direction. Do not permit the cheese to boil. When the cheese is
melted add the egg and seasoning, and stir until blended. Then add a pinch
of bicarbonate of soda, and serve on buttered toast which has been previously

paste two-thirds of a pound of flour, three-quarters of a pound of butter, one
ounce of sugar, a little salt, and six eggs. Beat the eggs in gradually. Then
spread the sponge over the top and mix into the paste. Cover with a cloth
and allow to raise until double in size. Then work together again, and place
in a box for several hours to harden before using. Mould into small round
balls, place in baking pans, and allow to raise until about one-third above
their original size. Brush over with egg, make a cross-cut on top, and bake
in a rather brisk oven.</p>

<p><b>Coffee cake.</b> Put one pound of flour in a bowl. Dissolve an ounce of
yeast in a gill of lukewarm milk, add it to the flour with two eggs, and work
to a medium-stiff dough. Cover with a cloth and allow to raise till double

in size. Then work in thoroughly three ounces of butter, two ounces of
sugar, a pinch of salt, a pinch of nutmeg, and the juice and rind of one lemon.
Allow to raise again for about an hour, when the dough will be ready to bake.
This dough is the foundation for all kinds of coffee cake.</p>

<p><b>Tea biscuits.</b> Three pounds of flour, one-half pound of butter, one quart
of milk, three ounces of baking powder, three ounces of sugar, and a little salt.
Sift the sugar, salt and baking powder with the flour; add the butter and milk,
and make a dough on the table about one-half inch thick. Cut with a round
cutter about the size of a dollar, place in a buttered pan, moisten the top with
milk, and bake in a hot oven for about fifteen minutes.</p>

<p><b>Boiled beef with vegetables.</b> The meat should be juicy, well-flavored and
tender. The brisket, cross rib and rump are the best portions. The wide ribs
at the end of a rib roast are also very good. Tie the beef with a string and put
into boiling water; clear from scum, add salt, and garnish with carrots, onions,
turnips, celery, leeks and Savoy cabbage. The cabbage may be tied with a
string to prevent disintegration. A good way is to put all the vegetables into
a net as they can thus be withdrawn at once. Allow the meat to simmer gently
on the side of the range, but do not let it come to a boil. When done cut in
slices, not too thin, and garnish with the vegetables neatly arranged around
the beef. Serve separately, either cream horseradish sauce, piquante, tomato,
or bouillon horseradish sauce. A little of its own broth should be poured over
the meat before serving.</p>

<p><b>Horseradish sauce in cream.</b> Cream sauce with fresh-grated horseradish
and salt and pepper.</p>

<p><b>Horseradish sauce with bouillon.</b> Put two fresh-grated horseradish roots
in sauté pan with four ounces of butter. Cover and put in oven for five minutes.
Add two grated rolls and return to oven for two minutes more. Then add
bouillon enough to form the sauce. The bread will swell and give the necessary
body. Add a pinch of sugar, salt and pepper.</p>

<p><b>Cold horseradish sauce, English style.</b> To two fresh-grated horseradish
roots add salt, a teaspoonful of English mustard, a teaspoonful of Worcestershire
sauce, and a spoonful of vinegar, mixed well. Then add one pint of
stiff-whipped cream.</p>

<p><b>Bouillon.</b> Broth from boiled beef, strained.</p>

<p><b>Puff paste crescents.</b> Two pounds of flour, one pound of butter, one pint
of milk, one ounce of salt, one and one-half ounces of sugar and two ounces
of yeast dissolved in warm water. Mix one-half pound of the flour with one-half
pint of water and the dissolved yeast. Stand in warm place for about
twenty minutes. Put the remainder of flour on board and mix in the yeast
paste; when sufficiently risen, add salt, sugar and milk, make a stiff dough
and allow to stand for a few minutes. Roll out, put the butter into the dough
as for ordinary puff paste, and roll in the same way, but giving it only half
the number of turns.</p>

<p><b>Stock for soup.</b> Two pounds of beef bones and a marrow bone, if you
can obtain one, two gallons of water, a carrot, onion, leek, piece of parsley,
a bouquet garni, salt and pepper. Boil for three hours. Strain.</p>

<p><b>Puff paste (feuilletage).</b> Take one pound of flour and one cup of water
and make a smooth paste, but not too soft. Form into a square loaf and let it
set for about fifteen minutes. Roll out on floured board about one-half inch
thick, and place in the center one pound of butter, well-worked and flexible.
Fold the edges of the paste over the butter and roll out about one-quarter
inch thick, taking care that the butter does not run out of the dough. Brush
off the flour and fold in three. Roll out again to the same thickness as before
and repeat the folding. Put in cool place or ice box for about one-half
hour, then roll and fold as before. Again rest for one-half hour, and then roll
and fold again. The paste will then have six turns in all, and after a little
rest it can be used.</p>

<p><b>Brown gravy.</b> One pound of veal bones, cut in pieces and browned in
oven, with one carrot, one onion, a little thyme, one bay leaf, two cloves and
three ounces of butter. Baste well, then add three ounces of flour, allow to
brown a little, and then add two quarts of water and boil for two full hours.
Season with salt, and strain. This gravy is used as a foundation for many
fancy sauces, such as sauce Madère, etc.</p>

<p><b>Cold fillet of sole, Raven.</b> Cook four fillets of sole in white wine and
place on a platter. Simmer two spoonsful of finely chopped shallots in butter,
add a few chopped fresh mushrooms, one chopped tomato and the wine used
for cooking the fish. Reduce until it becomes thick, cool off, add some chives
and chervil chopped fine, and a little mayonnaise. Spread over the fillets,
and cover with a mayonnaise rose. Decorate to taste with fancy-cut truffles,
pickles, etc. Serve very cold.</p>

<p><b>Consommé Sévigné.</b> White meat of chicken and smoked beef tongue cut
Julienne, (in the shape of matches). Serve in consommé with a sprinkle of

parsley, a few pepper berries, one bay leaf and a clove. Stir well and add
slowly the hot stock. Soak twelve leaves of gelatine in cold water for ten
minutes and add. Bring to a boil slowly, stirring from time to time. When
it comes to a boil it must be clear. Strain through very fine cheese cloth,
being careful not to stir up the meat so that it will cloud the broth. Season
with salt and a very little Cayenne, add a glass of good sherry, and allow
to cool.</p>

<p><b>Meringue à la crème, Chantilly.</b> Whip some cream until stiff, add some
powdered sugar, flavor with vanilla. Put one spoonful between each two

<p><b>Scrambled eggs with asparagus tips.</b> Put some asparagus tips in butter,
season with salt and pepper, simmer till hot, and add to the eggs.</p>

<p><b>Eggs Boremis.</b> Put an egg in a well-buttered cocotte dish, season with
salt and pepper, put plenty of grated cheese and a piece of butter on top of
all, and bake in oven.</p>

<p><b>Cocoa.</b> Put two tablespoonsful of cocoa in a pot with one-half cup of
water and boil for a minute. Add two cups of milk, bring to a boil, and strain.
Serve powdered sugar separate. May also be made with water only, omitting
the milk.</p>

<p><b>Fillet of bass, Dieppoise.</b> Cook the fillets "au vin blanc." Dish up on
platter with lobster sauce and oysters, mushrooms, truffles, shrimps and mussels
cut in small squares.</p>

<p><b>Chicken sauté, Marengo.</b> Joint of chicken, season with salt and pepper
and put in pan in very hot olive oil. When nice and brown on both sides add
four chopped shallots and a little garlic and allow them to get hot, but not
brown. Then add one-half glass of white wine and reduce. Add one cup of
brown gravy, one cup of chopped tomatoes and one can of French mushrooms.
Cook for fifteen minutes. Dish up and garnish with eggs and croûtons fried
in oil, chopped parsley, and a few slices of truffle on top.</p>

<p><b>Pie paste.</b> One and one-half pounds of flour, one-half pound of lard, one-half
pound of butter and a pinch of salt. Mix all together and add enough
water, (about one cup), to make a rather stiff dough. Keep in cool place
or ice box.</p>

<p><b>Apple pie.</b> For two pies line the plates with pie paste rolled very thin. Slice
six good sized apples, add one-quarter of a pound of sugar and a teaspoonful
of powdered cinnamon, mix and fill the plates. Wet the edges of the dough
and cover with paste also rolled thin. Wash over with egg, make a few cuts
in the center so the steam may escape while baking, and put in a moderate
oven. When done dust with powdered sugar, and serve hot or cold as desired.
If the apples are coarse it will be well to boil them a little in water with a piece
of cinnamon and a very little sugar.</p>

put shaved ice in large glass around the smaller one. In small glass put sliced
grapefruit mixed with powdered sugar. Tie a ribbon, with neat bow, around
the glass.</p>

<p><b>Eggs Benedict.</b> Split an English muffin, toast on the inside, place on each
half a small slice of broiled ham, on the ham a poached egg, cover with Hollandaise
sauce, and place a piece of truffle on top.</p>

<p><b>Layer cake.</b> Eight eggs, one-half pound of sugar, one-half pound of flour,
one-quarter pound of melted butter, and some flavoring extract. Beat the
eggs with the sugar, on slow fire until warm, remove and continue beating
until cold. Mix the flour in lightly and then add the melted butter, little by
little, and the flavoring. Do not mix too much. Pour into a well-buttered
mould and bake in a moderate oven for about three-quarters of an hour. Allow
to cool, cut in three or four slices, and fill with cream, or jelly, or marmalade,
as desired. Glacé the top with icing and decorate. The American style layer
cake is mixed in the same manner, but baked in shallow moulds, requiring only
about ten minutes in the oven. The filling is then placed between the cakes,
instead of slicing.</p>

<p><b>Chocolate layer cake.</b> Bake some layers as for moka cake, and put three
or four, one on top of another, with chocolate butter cream filling between.
The filling is made in the same manner as moka filling, but use one ounce of
melted chocolate or cocoa instead of the coffee flavor. Glacé the top of the
cake with chocolate frosting and decorate with some of the chocolate cream
filling, using pastry bag with fancy tube.</p>

<p><b>Chicken, Edward VII.</b> Boil the chicken in stock and stuff with rice as
for Chicken Diva. Add small squares of truffles and goose liver natural. Serve
with curry sauce.</p>

water ice.</p>

<p><b>Fried fillet of sole.</b> Clean and trim the fillets, season with salt and pepper,
roll in flour, then in beaten eggs, then in bread crumbs, and fry in swimming
hot lard for five minutes. Remove and serve on napkin with quartered lemons
and fried parsley. Sauce separate.</p>

<p><b>Rémoulade sauce.</b> Take a handful of spinach, one of watercress and one
of parsley and mash fine in a mortar. Put in a cloth and press out the juice.
Mix the juice with a pint and a half of mayonnaise, add four chopped gherkins
and some sliced chives.</p>

<p><b>Crab meat, Monza.</b> Wash carefully one pound of fresh mushrooms, and
cut each one in four. Put in sauté pan with two ounces of butter and simmer
for thirty minutes. When the mushrooms are soft add the meat of one crab
cooked in cream. Before serving add one gill of dry sherry wine.</p>

<p><b>Crab meat in cream.</b> Remove the meat from the shell of a boiled crab.
In a sauce pan put a piece of butter the size of an egg, and place on stove.
When warm add two spoonsful of flour and allow to become hot, then add one
pint of boiling milk and one-fourth of a pint of hot cream. Stir well and boil
for ten minutes. Season with salt and Cayenne pepper, then add the crab meat
and serve in deep dish. Serve dry toast separate.</p>

<p><b>Chicken dumplings.</b> (Quenelles de volaille). Take the breast of a raw fowl
and trim carefully away the fat, using the white meat only. Chop very fine
and pass through a fine sieve, place in a bowl on ice, season with salt and
Cayenne pepper, and with a wooden spoon stir in little by little some very
thick cream (not whipped), which has been kept on ice. Add the cream until
you have nearly double the amount of force meat. Have two teaspoons in cold
water. Take one and fill with the force meat, make a little hole in the middle
and fill with goose liver purée and close up. Remove the dumpling from the
first spoon with the other one and place on a buttered pan, and continue. When
enough are formed cover with stock and bring to the boiling point, then set
off the fire and let stand for ten minutes on the back of the range. The force
meat may be used for small dumplings without the purée of goose liver; or
some other filling may be used. Make them small for garnishing consommé, vol
au vent, patties, financière, tortue, etc. The force meat is also used to make
timbales of chicken.</p>

<p><b>Sauce Allemande.</b> Cut up three pounds of veal bones, put in vessel with
two gallons of water, bring to a boil and skim. Add one onion, a carrot, a little
celery and leek, some pepper berries, two cloves, a sprig of thyme and some
salt. Boil for two hours and strain. Put in sauce pan three ounces of butter,
when hot add two ounces of flour and heat again. Then add a pint and a half
of the broth, boil for ten minutes, season and strain. This is the foundation
of many fancy sauces.</p>

<p><b>Potage Jackson.</b> Potato soup with small pieces of macaroni added.</p>

<p class="center b12">An All-Around Cook Book for the Kitchen, Pastry
Room, Pantry, Storeroom, and Beverage Room</p>

<p>The opening chapter is on "Table Service," and leads off with the arrangement of the bill of fare,
followed with a chapter on wines, including a list of the different wines appropriate for the different
courses, and the wines usually called for at dinners of Americans, Frenchmen and Germans, respectively.
This is followed by a system of menu-compiling for course dinners ranging from 4 to 36 covers, and
stating the time it should take to serve the dinners.</p>

<p>How to lay and decorate the table; the seating of the host and guests; the fixing of the sideboard; the
duties of the steward and waiters; dinner table etiquette, the manner of serving the different courses,
including wines, and the windup with the tea service are cleverly explained. The French and Russian
service are explained and a list is presented of the china, glassware, silver, etc., required for a dinner
of twenty-four persons. Next comes valuable information regarding breakfasts, luncheons and suppers.</p>

<p class="center b11">Note the Diversity of the Contents</p>

<p>
There is a table of supplies in which is given the French
and English names of the foods and the time of year each

a cook book&mdash;it is readable to those who are not
so much interested in how to make salads as in
the enjoyment of them. The great charm of the

photographs in the natural colors, so that the

<p class="p2"><b>Pastry for the Restaurant (Richards)</b><span class="flright">$1.00</span></p>

<p>A vest pocket book of 158 pages, is, as its title
indicates, especially produced for the use of bakers
employed in restaurants and European plan
hotels. The style of work required for the American
plan hotel with table d'hote meal, and that
for the European plan hotel restaurant, where
each article is sold for a separate price, has
brought about a demand for a book with recipes
and methods especially adapted for the preparation
of bakery and pastry goods for individual
sale. The first chapter is devoted to French
pastries, which are now so generally sold, yet so
little understood, because of the misnomer title;
then follows cakes and tarts of every kind; pies,
in great variety; puddings, hot and cold; ices,
ice creams, and many specialties, all set forth
with ingredients, quantities, and methods of mixing
and preparing, and instructions for oven or
temperature control. Mr. Richards' other books
have become standard the world over, and this
one will be equally reliable. The index to this
book makes a very complete reference to popular
pastry goods and will be found valuable as a reminder.

<p class="p2"><b>Drinks (Jacques Straub)</b><span class="flright">$1.00</span></p>

<p>This book is full of genuine pre-prohibition recipes
for mixed Drinks. The author was wine steward
of the famous Blackstone Hotel Bar in
Chicago. It is an authoritative treatise on how
mixed drinks should be made. In addition to 700
practical recipes, it has a preface by "Oscar" of
the Waldorf, and an opening chapter outlining
the care and medicinal value of wines.</p>

<p>We recommend "Drinks" as the book being
used by the finest hotels and clubs, by connoisseurs
of beverages, and as a book that is authoritative
and exceedingly practical because it was
written by one who knew how, and was first
published in the days before prohibition (1914).</p>

<p class="p2"><b>The Menu Translator (Duchamp &amp; Jenning)</b><span class="flright">$3.00</span></p>

<p>This book was formerly known as the "Universal
Dictionary of Menus" and served as a
guide to thousands of menu-makers, stewards,
and chefs. Today, it has been completely revised,
greatly enlarged and lists about 12,000
translations in French, English and German.
Items are carefully arranged under 25 headings,
making it easy to find any item. Now in
its seventh edition, and one of the newest and
most complete works of its kind. 137 pages,
5 x 7½ inches.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Advertising of Hotels (Clarence Madden)</b><span class="flright">$2.00</span></p>

<p>This is the first practical, comprehensive inquiry
into hotel advertising ever made available. It is
the only book which treats the problem of selling
rooms and service in its entirety&mdash;promotion,
publicity, "in-the-house", "word-of-mouth", copy,
appropriation, media selection, and agency contact.
Mr. Madden is acquainted with both sides
of the advertising picture. His book brings the
two into sharp focus and shows their proper relationship....
Anyone who is in any way affected
by hotel advertising should be sure to have on
hand a copy of "THE ADVERTISING OF
HOTELS" for study, reference, and guidance.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>The Van Orman System of Hotel Control</b><span class="flright">$ .50</span></p>

<p>A book illustrating and describing the many forms
used in the hotels of the Van Orman Chain of
hotels.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>American Plan Check System (Lewis)</b><span class="flright">$1.00</span></p>

<p>This is the only published book that treats intelligently
of the waiter's work from bus boy to
head waiter, for both hotel and restaurant requirements.

of table wares, salad making, table setting, carving,
dishing up, handling of sea foods, building
of banquet tables, and many other useful items

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
